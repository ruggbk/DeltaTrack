"""Anchor extraction for PDF bills.

An Anchor is a landmark label (TITLE / SEC. / account heading) the GPO PDF
carries reliably. The diff layer attaches the nearest preceding anchor to each
hunk as a "where am I" breadcrumb. When no anchor resolves cleanly, the diff
falls back to the page/line citation alone — anchors degrade, they don't gate.

Operates on `parsers.pdf_text.Page` objects, which carry per-line source PDF

#
# A catchline wraps because GPO ran out of column, so its continuations are still TITLE:
# set in caps, no lowercase, until the `.—` hands over to body prose. That shape is the
# real signal that the title is still going, and `_catchline_shaped` tests for it.
#
# Why the shape test rather than simply a bigger line budget. The budget used to be 2,
# which silently discarded every subsection whose title wrapped onto a third line: at
# GPO's ~45 characters per line it fit about 122 characters, and on 119-hr-1 every title
# <=122 chars was found (929 of them) while every title >=127 chars was missed (5),
# nothing in between. But raising the number is not free, because a subsection with NO
# catchline at all is only stopped from reaching forward by that same number. At 6 the
# join ran out of five such subsections, across an account heading and a `SEC.` line, and
# terminated on the FOLLOWING section's `.—`:
#
#   115-hr-5895 p49:16 -> "(c) A waiver under subsection (b) shall not be effective
#                          until 15 days ... SEC. 307. (a) NEW REGIONAL RESERVES"  (295 ch)
#
# `_RUNIN_CONTINUATION_STOP` does not catch those: it ends the window at a quote or an
# enumerator, and none of those runaways opens with either. Measured over the committed
# corpus, subsection anchors whose text contains "SEC." went 0 at budget 2, to 6 at budget
# 6, to more as the budget grows. The count was doing the precision work, so spending it
# on title length alone traded one silent defect for another.
#
# So EVERY continuation must look like a title; there is no unconditional window. An
# earlier revision let the first two join unconditionally, to be a strict superset of the
# old rule, but that is where the remaining fabrications lived: two lines of prose followed
# by an all-caps heading still reached a `.—` that was not this subsection's. Applying the
# shape test from the first continuation measures IDENTICALLY on every committed PDF (1069
# subsection anchors either way, none gained, none lost), so the exemption was buying no
# recall and only carrying risk.
#
# The rule is now one sentence with no line count in it: follow the title while it still
# reads as title. That recovers all 5 genuine long catchlines (including the 258-char
# 119-hr-1 sec. 112207(b), a $15,000,000 appropriation) and fabricates none.
#
# Known limitation: a MIXED-CASE catchline that wraps cannot be followed, because its
# continuation does not read as title. All 12 mixed-case catchlines in the corpus fit on one
# line (longest 43 chars), so none is affected, but a bill that both sets catchlines in
# mixed case and wraps one would miss it. That is the precision-first side of the trade this
# module already takes: a missed anchor degrades to a page/line citation, while a fabricated
# one puts the next section's title on this subsection.

    The look-ahead skips blank lines and parenthetical qualifiers; an unattached
    (size-less) next line counts as body (conservative — skipping toward the next
    heading would wrongly drop a leaf). Run-in subsection headers (`(a) …`) and
    parenthetical qualifiers are never accounts. The account/grouping anchor keeps
    the heading's own page/line; the agency anchor takes the run's FIRST line.

    The agency signal is bounded: a *leaf account* name that itself wraps across
    heading lines is indistinguishable from an agency by size/position, so the join
    can absorb a wrapped account fragment. The dangle guard (`_dangles`) rejects the
    worst of these; the rest is the leveled-tree problem (#54/#108). Exact on the
    clean bill (118-hr-8752), a tolerant floor on the hard one (118-s-4795).

    Body must be confirmed positively (at body size) rather than "anything that
    isn't a heading": a wrapped run-in header continuation can sit in the heading
    band and be followed by another (enum-prefixed) run-in header — neither body
    nor a recognized heading — and must not be emitted.

        onto a line that, read alone, is an uppercase heading in-band followed by

        Walk back over the wrapped run (contiguous in-band uppercase headings,

        Load-bearing invariant: the walk only reaches a SEC. through a contiguous
        run of in-band uppercase headings — any body line stops it (returns False).
        This relies on GPO appropriations sections carrying body prose right after
        the SEC. number ("SEC. 101. (a) The Secretary…"), so a real account heading
        is always separated from a preceding SEC. by that body and never reaches the

        false-skip the account, but that needs a catchline-style SEC. directly

        wraps appear only in authorization bills, which have no accounts). Telling

    SERVICES``, ``GENERAL PROVISIONS``) is the greedy run of body-size all-caps
    heading lines IMMEDIATELY following a standalone ``TITLE n`` line, joined to the
    heading band: a line ending in an ASCII hyphen de-hyphenates onto the next (a

    with a space. The run stops at the first heading-band line (agency/account), body
    prose line, or ``SEC.`` line. The anchor takes the run's FIRST line.

    Why "immediately after TITLE": verified across one reported-in-House print from
    each of the 12 appropriations subcommittees (FY2025) plus the Senate CJS pair —
    the department heading is always printed directly under its title, while the
    body-size all-caps false positives (statutory-citation wraps like ``U.S.C.

    Inline em-dash titles (``TITLE VIII—ADDITIONAL GENERAL PROVISIONS``) are skipped:
    the body-size run below them is the title's own wrapped name, not a major.

    Stacked vs wrapped (DeltaTrack#130): a title can carry TWO distinct stacked
    body-size headings (e.g. Energy-Water ``CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL`` /
    ``DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY``), which size and casing alone cannot tell from one
    wrapped name (both are body-size all-caps). The run is split at each line-fullness
    hard break (`_split_major_run`): a line that broke before the justified column
    filled is an intentional stack boundary, so it starts a new major. Known limit:
    two stacked departments whose UPPER line nearly fills the column read as a wrap

    For a TITLE anchor: returns just `("TITLE I",)`.
    For a PREAMBLE (front-matter) anchor: returns just `("Front Matter",)` —
    it's top-level, preceding the first TITLE.
    For an ACCOUNT anchor: `("TITLE I", "OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT")`, but when a
    carry-over agency (`MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE`) precedes it within the same title,
    the account nests under it: `("TITLE I", "MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE", "OPERATIONS
    AND SUPPORT")` (DeltaTrack#104). One agency carries over several accounts, so
    the account need not be immediately preceded by the agency anchor — the walk
    passes through intervening sibling accounts. It does NOT pass a grouping/section
    boundary: an account after `ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS` is title-level, not
    agency-scoped.
    For an AGENCY or GROUPING anchor: `("TITLE I", "MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE")`, or
    just `("MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE",)` with no preceding TITLE.
    For a SECTION anchor: `("TITLE IV", "SEC. 406")` normally, but when a
    grouping header (`ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS`) precedes the section within the
    same title, the section nests under it: `("TITLE I", "ADMINISTRATIVE
    PROVISIONS", "SEC. 101")` (DeltaTrack#103). A general-provisions title now carries
    its own `GENERAL PROVISIONS` major (DeltaTrack#105), so its sections resolve to
    `("TITLE V", "GENERAL PROVISIONS", "SEC. 501")` — three levels via the major, even
    with no grouping header.

    For a MAJOR / department anchor (DeltaTrack#105): the body-size heading under a
    TITLE deepens the chain to `("TITLE I", "DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT", "MANAGEMENT
    DIRECTORATE", "OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT")`. One major scopes the whole title, so it
    is captured INDEPENDENTLY of the agency `agency_blocked` gate (a title-level
    account after a grouping boundary still carries the major) and threaded leftmost,
    just inside the TITLE.

    Breadcrumb DEPTH is detection-path dependent: major/agency/grouping parents exist
    only on the size path, so a low-coverage/no-band bill (legacy fallback) yields a
    shallower chain for the same logical account. Consumers must not assume a major or
    agency segment is always present.
