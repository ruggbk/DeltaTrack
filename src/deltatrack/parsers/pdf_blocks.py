"""PDF observation production: the anchor-delimited blocks the differ compares.

Slice 1 of the ADR 0020 PDF convergence work
(``docs/research/pdf-matching-convergence/``). This module holds the block-formation
machinery **relocated unchanged from** ``diff_pdf``; no behaviour moves with it, and
``tests/test_pdf_observation_emission.py`` pins the emitted sequence byte for byte across
the relocation.

**Why it is here and not in the differ.** What a PDF observation *is* was defined by the
module that matches them. Two things follow from that, and the second is the blocking one:

- Observation production and matching policy could not be changed independently, or
  reviewed apart.
- ADR 0019 requires a **parser revision** "derived from the parser implementation, [changing]
  whenever code capable of changing the emitted observations changes". While block formation
  lived in ``diff_pdf``, that revision would have had to hash the matcher — so editing a
  threshold would have changed observation identity and quarantined every stored artifact,
  while a genuine re-segmentation and a matching tweak would have been indistinguishable.

With the machinery here, a PDF parser revision is a hash over ``pdf_text``, ``pdf_anchors``
and this module, and the matcher is not in it.

**The emitted sequence, stated once.** The PDF observation sequence for one document is
exactly the blocks :func:`_group_into_blocks` returns, in the order it returns them — the
**post-filter** sequence. An ordinal indexes that. Zero-content blocks arising from the
run-in subsection coordinate collision (DeltaTrack#96 Seam #2) are not observations: they are
intermediate artifacts of deriving the sequence, and all 190 across the committed corpus stay
addressable through the anchor stream, the structure tree and a breadcrumb. See
``tests/test_pdf_observation_emission.py``, which is where that rule is enforced rather than
merely described.

**Dependency direction.** This module must never import matching or classification policy
from ``diff_pdf``; the arrow runs

    pdf_text -> pdf_anchors -> pdf_blocks -> diff_pdf

One import here runs against the grain and is recorded rather than hidden:
``extract_amounts`` comes from ``deltatrack.diff_bill``, so this is the first module under
``parsers/`` to depend on a differ. It is acyclic today and behaviour-preserving, and the
alternative — parameterising the strip rule so it could stay in ``diff_pdf`` — would have put
block-formation policy back in the matcher, defeating the slice. ``extract_amounts`` is a
pure text→amounts utility whose home in ``diff_bill`` is historical
([#62](https://github.com/AgoraDMV/DeltaTrack/issues/62)); promoting it to a neutral module
is the clean fix and belongs in its own change, not in a relocation slice.
