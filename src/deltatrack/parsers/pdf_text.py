"""PDF text extraction with the smallest set of primitives that fixture cases require.

Text is extracted with pypdfium2 (PDFium, Chrome's PDF engine). `Page` is
line-aware: every cleaned `Line` carries the source PDF's printed line number
(1-based, the small digit GPO renders in the left margin). Phase 2 uses those
numbers to produce hunk citations like `p.61 L5` and to attach anchor breadcrumbs
by binary-searching the anchor list. The page-level `text` property is a derived
join, so existing consumers (recall test, `page_range_text`) keep working without
change.

PDFium's raw page text needs three normalizations before the line-numbered cleaner
can read it (`normalize_raw`): CRLF endings, soft-hyphenated breaks rendered as a
U+FFFE glyph with the next margin number glued inline, and footer chrome glued onto
a line whose word hyphenates onto the next page. The running `•HR` header also
floats to the top of the reading order, so chrome stripping (`strip_page_chrome`)
removes it in place rather than from the bottom.

#
# A per-page pass over raw PDFium chars that recovers each printed line's glyph
# size, keyed by the GPO margin line number so it joins to the string pipeline's
# Lines without depending on PDFium's (scrambled) reading order. The recovered
# size is `FPDFText_GetFontSize × √(matrix.a² + matrix.b²)`: the convenience
# GetFontSize returns 1.0 for every glyph (GPO defines the font at size 1 and
# scales via the text matrix), so the true scale lives in the matrix.
#
# Performance (#89): two bulk/probing shortcuts cut per-glyph FFI calls ~50 %.
#
#   A) Codepoints: `textpage.get_text_range()` returns all page chars in one call;
#      index i in the returned str is the same glyph as char index i in
#      FPDFText_GetCharBox / FPDFText_GetMatrix, so `ord(text[i])` replaces the
#      per-glyph `FPDFText_GetUnicode(raw, i)` call. If `len(text) != n` (non-BMP
#      or surrogate mismatch), the hot loop falls back to per-glyph GetUnicode.
#
#   B) Font size: SAMPLE `FPDFText_GetFontSize` on the first glyph only, then
#      apply that verdict to the whole page. This assumes GPO's page-uniform
#      size-1 font (every glyph returns 1.0; the scale lives in the matrix), so
#      the scale is just √(a²+b²) with no further GetFontSize calls. It is a
#      sample, NOT a per-page proof: a hypothetical mixed-size page whose first
#      glyph reads 1.0 would mis-size the rest — never seen in GPO output, but the
#      reason the sampled value is rechecked per page rather than assumed once per
#      doc. When the sample differs from 1.0 the whole page falls back to the
#      original per-glyph GetFontSize × √(a²+b²).
