"""Block-level diff for PDF bill versions, parallel to diff_bill.py for XML.

No shebang since #398 -- see `diff_bill`'s module docstring for why a module inside a
package cannot be executed directly. `./diff_pdf.py` at the repo root wraps this.

A bill is grouped into anchor-delimited blocks (TITLE / SEC. / account heading)
on each side, then aligned section-by-section. Lines before the first anchor
form a preamble block. The block is the natural unit of comparison — it mirrors
how `diff_bill.match_nodes` operates on BillTree nodes for XML and avoids the
SequenceMatcher line-level fragmentation that produced over-counted hunks and
missed added/moved sections.

**The blocks themselves are produced by `parsers.pdf_blocks`, not here.** That module
owns observation production — flattening, cross-page hyphen rejoin, anchor-delimited
grouping, heading-chrome stripping — and this one owns matching and classification
policy. The split is ADR 0020 slice 1, and it is what lets an ADR 0019 PDF parser
revision be derived without hashing the matcher; see that module's docstring. This
module consumes those blocks and must remain downstream of them.

Within matched blocks, the renderer applies word-level diff against the joined
block text. The classifier produces:

- `added` — block present only in v2
- `removed` — block present only in v1
- `moved` — block bodies similar but anchors differ (renumbered SEC.)
- `modified` — paired blocks with different bodies

Reuses amount matching (`match_amounts`) from diff_bill.py and text similarity from
similarity.py: `text_similarity` for the round-1 similarity rule and `move_candidates` for
round-2 retrieval, plus both cutoffs. Round 1 deliberately no longer uses the gated
`text_similarity_at_least` — that call returns 0.0 below its bound, which put a correspondence
cutoff inside the evidence stage; see `_pdf_similarity_signals`.

# The PDF mirror of `diff_bill`'s round constants and stage types. Round 1 is the

# `_align_blocks` (slice 5 extracts the split). Round 2 is the move pass, and slice 4 is
# what moved it OFF the classified hunk stream and in front of classification.

#: The assignment rounds this pipeline runs, in order. Carried on a
#: :class:`PdfSettledCorrespondence` so classification can reproduce the legacy record order
#: and label a move -- not a ranking and not a quality signal, exactly as in ``diff_bill``.
PATH_ROUND = 1
MOVE_ROUND = 2

#: Word-level overlap of two block bodies, the one signal both rounds' evidence carries.
#: Round 2 promotes a retrieval score to it (ADR 0020: a score is not evidence until named);
#: round 1 computes it for the express purpose of deciding the pairing, so it is natively
#: evidence there. One name for one measure, as in ``diff_bill``.
WORD_OVERLAP = "word_overlap"

#: Whether two aligned blocks carry byte-identical bodies. The PDF analogue of ``diff_bill``'s
#: ``body_unchanged``, and deliberately not that name: XML asks whether the word-level diff of
#: two *normalized* bodies is empty, this asks whether two block texts are equal. Same role in
#: the rule, different measure, so a different name (ADR 0021 §3).
TEXT_IDENTICAL = "text_identical"

#: Round 1's two retrieval mechanisms, named so a proposal says which one surfaced a pair.
#: ``_block_key`` + ``SequenceMatcher`` produce the ``equal`` runs; the positional zip inside a
#: ``replace`` produces the rest. They are separate invocations rather than one because they are
#: separate rules with separate failure modes — the aligner can pass over a true counterpart
#: when a duplicate key draws the alignment elsewhere (§7.2), while the positional rule pairs by
#: position alone and is what gate 6's crossing fixture pins.
BLOCK_KEY_ALIGNMENT = "block_key_alignment"
POSITIONAL_REPLACE = "positional_replace"

#: How two aligned blocks' anchors relate. **Descriptive, not a verdict**: it says what the two
#: labels are to each other and nothing about whether the provision moved. It exists because the
#: legacy move rule reads the anchor relationship, and ADR 0020 requires the input to a decision
#: to arrive as named evidence rather than as a stage reaching back into raw ``_Block`` state.
#:
#: Three states, all represented, because two-state booleans hide the third: ``missing`` is not
#: ``different``. A block without an anchor is the preamble, whose label is absent rather than
#: changed, and the legacy rule treats the two cases differently.

#: Why assignment reports a settled correspondence as a move, or ``None`` where it does not.
#:
#: **Provenance, deliberately not a legislative claim.** Slice 6's study established that neither
#: name below is a measurement of relocation: 13 of the 20 round-1 bases are anchor line-wrap
#: artifacts, and 9 of the 145 round-2 moves relocate with an unchanged anchor
#: (``docs/research/pdf-matching-convergence/moved-semantics.md``). The semantic target
#: for canonical ``moved`` is "the same provision at a different legislative location", which
#: needs a stable location identity the parser does not yet carry. These names therefore say how
#: the correspondence was settled, and the question of what ``moved`` should *mean* stays open

    the true ratio below its bound. That put a correspondence cutoff inside the *evidence*: a
    pair whose real overlap was 0.30 was recorded as ``0.0``, so assignment handed a threshold
    of 0.20 revoked a pairing it should have kept, and the threshold parameter was not the sole
    authority ADR 0020 requires it to be. Evidence describes; it must not censor at the number
    the next stage is supposed to own.

    The optimization was measured before being dropped rather than after: exact similarity for
    every non-identical aligned pair costs **+0.9%** on a full-corpus ``diff_pdfs`` sweep
    (5.552s → 5.600s over 23 pairs), which is inside the 3.2% run-to-run spread, and produces
    byte-identical output. The gate saved little because the identical-text short-circuit above
    already removes the large majority of pairs before it, which is the population XML's
    equivalent gate is actually paying for. ``test_pdf_matching_boundary``'s transcribed oracle
    has always used exact ``text_similarity`` and has always agreed with production, which is
    the same fact measured independently and committed long before this slice.

    **``word_overlap`` is present even when the texts are identical**, which is where this
    diverges from ``diff_bill``'s equivalent, and the divergence is forced rather than chosen:
    the move-basis rule reads this signal, so a renamed anchor over an identical body needs the
    value. Before slice 6a that reader was *classification*, which is the coupling 6a removes —
    the signal stays, and it is now read by an assignment rule instead.

    ``anchor_relation`` is described here for every aligned pair, including pairs the similarity
    rule is about to revoke, for the same reason every pair gets a record at all: describing only
    the survivors would make the description depend on a decision downstream of it.

    Registry-free on purpose, and now threshold-free too: no correspondence cutoff appears in
    this function at all, which is what makes ``apply_pdf_similarity_revocation``'s parameter
    the only one that decides.
