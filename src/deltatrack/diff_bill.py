    flag *between* the two paths would have regressed, silently, since flags-first and
    flags-last still work.

    `parse_intermixed_args` is argparse's own answer to that, but it refuses a parser
    holding subparsers, so it cannot be switched on for the top-level parser -- only
    here, where `add_subparsers` hands control to the subcommand. It delegates back into
    `parse_known_args` with the positionals suppressed; the guard lets that inner call
    through, and is inert if a future argparse stops re-entering.

    The re-entry is NOT hypothetical: on CPython 3.12.0 through 3.12.7,
    `parse_known_intermixed_args` calls the public `self.parse_known_args`, so without
    the guard this override recurses into itself until RecursionError -- every `compare`
    invocation fails, legacy two-path form included. CPython 3.12.8 refactored the
    delegation to the private `_parse_known_args2`, so the guard passes through unused
    there. Verified with `inspect.getsource` and by running `build_parser()` on CPython
    3.12.0, 3.12.4, 3.12.7 (re-enter via the public method), 3.12.8, 3.12.12 and
    3.13.14 (call `_parse_known_args2`). `requires-python` is ">=3.12" and Ubuntu
    24.04 ships 3.12.3, so the re-entering band is supported and the guard stays.
    tests/test_diff_bill.py::TestIntermixedSubParserGuard simulates the re-entering
    shape by monkeypatching, so the guard is pinned on every interpreter -- not only
    on the CI floor leg that happens to run an interpreter from that band.

    `add_subparsers(parser_class=...)` binds EVERY subparser of this parser, not only
    `compare`: a future subcommand with a `nargs=REMAINDER` positional raises
    `TypeError: parse_intermixed_args: positional arg with nargs=...` at parse time.
