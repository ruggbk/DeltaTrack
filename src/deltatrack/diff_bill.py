    A reported bill holds the base text at body[0] and the committee substitute at body[1]. When

    removed. 114-hr-2029 is exactly this: v5 scores 0.809 similarity to v4's body[1] and 0.532
    to body[0], and the partition inverted that pairing on a committed corpus pair.

    local ``(oi, ni)``. Those are :func:`assign_group`'s, and keeping them out of here is what
    lets a test hand assignment evidence that disagrees with the node texts and watch which one
    it follows.

    ## Two authorities, and why neither can do the other's job

    **The ``CandidateSet`` is the admission authority.** Nothing is described until
    :meth:`~deltatrack.matching.CandidateSet.candidate_for` says retrieval proposed that
    observation pair *and* that the candidate carries a proposal from this population's own
    invocation. This is the ADR 0020 boundary made load-bearing rather than merely checked
    afterwards: reconstructing a pair from population membership alone would let "retrieval says
    this is not a candidate" and "assignment nevertheless selects it" hold at the same time,
    which is the state the intermediate value exists to make unreachable.

    **The population remains the invocation-local ordering authority.** The set is reached by
    lookup and never iterated, deliberately: its
    :meth:`~deltatrack.matching.CandidateSet.candidates` order is canonical by ordinal pair, and
    a stage that walked it to answer an admission question would be holding that order at the
    moment it built the sequence assignment consumes. So the loop below is over
    ``population.old`` x ``population.new``, and the emitted order is the population's, which is
    what makes ``(oi, ni)`` reconstructible downstream.

    The set also could not supply the local view on its own: every within-division population of
    a comparison runs under one :class:`~deltatrack.matching.RetrieverInvocation`, so filtering
    the comparison-scoped set by invocation yields the union across divisions with no
    division-local partition and no ordering. Admission is a per-pair question the set answers;
    the membership and order of *this* invocation's view are the population's.

    Both failures are refused rather than resolved -- see
    :func:`_refuse_a_candidate_retrieval_did_not_admit` -- and refused for the whole population
    before anything is measured, so a partial description can never be handed on.

    ## Two populations, two signal sets, and why the second carries no number

    A multi-candidate population gets :data:`WORD_OVERLAP` for every pair: the word-level ratio
    of the two normalized bodies, which is the quantity the fused matcher computed to decide the
    greedy competition. It is natively evidence here -- unlike round 2, where the same name is a
    promoted retrieval score.

    A 1x1 population gets **one record with no signals**, and that absence is the preserved
    behaviour rather than an omission. The fused matcher selected a sole candidate without
    computing a ratio, which skips 593 invocations' worth of ``text_similarity`` on the
    committed corpus; #623 measured the equivalent tidy-up at +21% on ``diff_bills`` and
    rejected it. So no ratio is computed and none is invented: an empty
    :class:`~deltatrack.matching.CorrespondenceEvidence` is valid under the checked-in contract,
    and a fabricated ``1.0`` or ``None`` would be a number a later reader could compare against
    a real one. The record exists because the candidate reaches assignment and every such

    evidence that disagrees with what recomputing the texts would say and it follows the
    evidence; that is what makes the boundary a fact rather than a comment, and
    ``tests/test_round1_stages.py`` bombs ``text_similarity`` while driving it to prove it.

    **There is no threshold here, and adding one would change matching policy.** The fused

    available, and the separate post-round-1 rule in :func:`apply_similarity_assignment_rule` is
    what revokes it afterwards. Those are two assignment acts in sequence, not one rule split in
    two, and folding ``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`` into this one would silently delete the
    composition.

    ## The ordering is policy, and it is local

    Multi-candidate populations reproduce ``sorted(candidates, reverse=True)`` over legacy
    ``(similarity, oi, ni)`` tuples: highest :data:`WORD_OVERLAP` first, ties broken on
    **descending** invocation-local ``oi`` and then **descending** local ``ni``, then greedy
    exclusivity -- once an observation is claimed it cannot be selected again.

    ``oi`` and ``ni`` are positions in ``population.old_refs`` / ``population.new_refs``,
    reconstructed here and stored nowhere. They are **not** ADR 0019 ordinals, not
    ``CandidateSet`` iteration positions and not positions in ``evidence``: #590 measured that
    substituting parser ordinals for them changes the selected correspondence, and B0 measured
    that using the candidate set's canonical order changes the selected links on 174 of 329
    greedy invocations. The same separation ``_greedy_move_links`` keeps on the round-2 side,
    for the same reason.

    A 1x1 population selects its sole candidate outright, without reading a signal -- which is
    what the greedy would do anyway, and what lets :func:`group_correspondence_evidence` leave
    the record empty.

    Leftovers follow the selections: old first in local order, then new, which is the order the
    fused matcher emitted them in and the order round 1b's population depends on.

    Malformed input raises rather than resolving itself. A population whose evidence is not
    exactly one record per retrieved candidate means the two stages disagree about what was
    retrieved, and quietly assigning over the subset would drop a candidate from the competition

    Orchestration only, and the same composition :func:`_match_collision_group` runs: retrieve,
    propose, describe, assign, route. What differs is that there is nothing for a second round to
    do -- a 1x1 assignment leaves nothing over, and a one-sided group is not retrieved at all --
    so the cross-division round has no population to be built from and is not run.

    **This is what B3 replaced, and the replacement is the point.** The pre-B3 fast path appended
    ``(old_nodes[0], new_nodes[0])`` directly, so the great majority of round-1 correspondences
    were selected by a tuple construction that formed no candidate, described nothing and reached
    no assignment stage. The candidate set was collision-path-complete and a recall figure read off
    it was wrong by the size of this population. It is now round-1-complete.

    **Retaining the fast path's cost profile is deliberate and is not the same as retaining the
    fast path.** The alternative -- sending every unique group through
    :func:`_match_collision_group` -- costs 2.96x the pre-B3 traversal on the committed corpus,
    because that path partitions by division, forms one population per division, and runs a second
    retrieval round over the leftovers. None of that is reachable for a group holding at most one
    observation per side. So this stays a separate orchestration over the SAME stages rather than
    a second implementation of them: no stage is duplicated here, and the two paths cannot diverge
    in what they admit, describe or select.

    An early estimate priced that alternative at 1.62x against a *pre-B1* collision path, which had
    no candidate set, no evidence records and no ``GroupAssignment``. B1 and B2 made that path cost
    more per group, so the thing B3 declines to do got more expensive while B3 was being reached;
    re-measured with every arm in one process it is roughly 2.9x, against roughly 2.4x for what
    shipped. Treat those as the ordering rather than as figures to quote: they move a few percent
    between runs, and the durable claim is that B3 sits between the two paths, nearer the cheaper
    one. PR #632 carries the measurement.

    **Zero ``text_similarity`` calls, preserved through the stages rather than around them.** A
    1x1 population takes :func:`group_correspondence_evidence`'s shortcut -- one record, no signals,
    no ratio -- which is the behaviour the fused matcher had and #623 measured the tidy-up of at
    +21%. It is preserved here by reaching the same branch, not by skipping the stage.

    **The one-sided group is routed unclaimed, not settled.** A ``(node, None)`` here is an
    unmatched observation exactly as it is on the collision path: round 2 may still pair it with a
    different partner, and nothing settles before :func:`settle_correspondences`.

    Leftovers are routed rather than assumed absent. A 1x1 assignment cannot produce one today,
    but reading assignment's answer is what keeps assignment the authority on what corresponds; an
    orchestrator that hardcoded "one link, no leftovers" would be re-deciding the cardinality it
    just asked for.

    contributes no assignment because it forms no pair -- there is nothing to decide.

    put two proposals for one pair in different objects where nothing can merge them, and a pair
    left unclaimed by its own division's assignment can legitimately be re-proposed by the
    cross-division round.

    **The set gates what may be described, and orders nothing.** Every pair
    :func:`group_correspondence_evidence` describes must be in it, carrying a proposal from the

    canonical ordinal-pair order is deliberately not the order any decision is made in, and

    the size of the unique-path population -- 14,001 of the committed corpus's pairings against
    the collision path's few thousand, which is not a rounding error. It is now every pair round 1
    considered.

    Still not *comparison-wide* recall, and the remaining gap is named rather than left implied:
    round 2 keeps its own retrieval (:func:`retrieve_move_candidates`) and its candidates do not
    accumulate here. A figure covering both rounds has to combine the two.

    later round may consult earlier matching state, but none of it may run after classification.

    Round 2 stays after :func:`apply_similarity_assignment_rule`, and that ordering is load-bearing

class _IntermixedSubParser(argparse.ArgumentParser):
    """A subparser whose optionals may sit anywhere among its positionals.

    argparse matches positionals greedily within each run *between* optionals, so a
    variadic positional swallows the whole first run: `compare old.xml --financial
    new.xml` would fail with "unrecognized arguments: new.xml" even though the
    two-required-positional parser this replaced accepted it. Every ordering that puts a
    flag *between* the two paths would have regressed, silently, since flags-first and
    flags-last still work.

    `parse_intermixed_args` is argparse's own answer to that, but it refuses a parser
    holding subparsers, so it cannot be switched on for the top-level parser -- only
    here, where `add_subparsers` hands control to the subcommand. It delegates back into
    `parse_known_args` with the positionals suppressed; the guard lets that inner call
    through, and is inert if a future argparse stops re-entering.

    The re-entry is NOT hypothetical: on CPython 3.12.0 through 3.12.7,
    `parse_known_intermixed_args` calls the public `self.parse_known_args`, so without
    the guard this override recurses into itself until RecursionError -- every `compare`
    invocation fails, legacy two-path form included. CPython 3.12.8 refactored the
    delegation to the private `_parse_known_args2`, so the guard passes through unused
    there. Verified with `inspect.getsource` and by running `build_parser()` on CPython
    3.12.0, 3.12.4, 3.12.7 (re-enter via the public method), 3.12.8, 3.12.12 and
    3.13.14 (call `_parse_known_args2`). `requires-python` is ">=3.12" and Ubuntu
    24.04 ships 3.12.3, so the re-entering band is supported and the guard stays.
    tests/test_diff_bill.py::TestIntermixedSubParserGuard simulates the re-entering
    shape by monkeypatching, so the guard is pinned on every interpreter -- not only
    on the CI floor leg that happens to run an interpreter from that band.

    `add_subparsers(parser_class=...)` binds EVERY subparser of this parser, not only
    `compare`: a future subcommand with a `nargs=REMAINDER` positional raises
    `TypeError: parse_intermixed_args: positional arg with nargs=...` at parse time.
