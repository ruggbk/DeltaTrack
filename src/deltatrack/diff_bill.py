    partitioning on the body looks like the matching fix. It is not: body_index is a node's
    POSITION IN ITS OWN DOCUMENT, and the same position does not mean the same text across
    versions.

    A reported bill holds the base text at body[0] and the committee substitute at body[1]. When
    the substitute is adopted, the NEXT version is a single body holding that substitute -- at
    index 0, because it is now the only body. Partitioning on the index pairs old body[0] (the
    base, superseded) with it and reports old body[1] (the text that actually survived) as
    removed. 114-hr-2029 is exactly this: v5 scores 0.809 similarity to v4's body[1] and 0.532
    to body[0], and the partition inverted that pairing on a committed corpus pair.

    Similarity already resolves both directions without the constraint, because it compares text
    rather than position. division_key is safe here in a way body_index is not -- a division's
    key is its header text, which is a name that travels with the content across versions. The
    key is carried on the node (#468); recovering it from the division's display label tied
    matching to a presentation choice, and the GPO form #66 asks for has no colon, so every
    division collapsed into one bucket and nodes silently paired across divisions.

class _IntermixedSubParser(argparse.ArgumentParser):
    """A subparser whose optionals may sit anywhere among its positionals.

    argparse matches positionals greedily within each run *between* optionals, so a
    variadic positional swallows the whole first run: `compare old.xml --financial
    new.xml` would fail with "unrecognized arguments: new.xml" even though the
    two-required-positional parser this replaced accepted it. Every ordering that puts a
    flag *between* the two paths would have regressed, silently, since flags-first and
    flags-last still work.

    `parse_intermixed_args` is argparse's own answer to that, but it refuses a parser
    holding subparsers, so it cannot be switched on for the top-level parser -- only
    here, where `add_subparsers` hands control to the subcommand. It delegates back into
    `parse_known_args` with the positionals suppressed; the guard lets that inner call
    through, and is inert if a future argparse stops re-entering.

    The re-entry is NOT hypothetical: on CPython 3.12.0 through 3.12.7,
    `parse_known_intermixed_args` calls the public `self.parse_known_args`, so without
    the guard this override recurses into itself until RecursionError -- every `compare`
    invocation fails, legacy two-path form included. CPython 3.12.8 refactored the
    delegation to the private `_parse_known_args2`, so the guard passes through unused
    there. Verified with `inspect.getsource` and by running `build_parser()` on CPython
    3.12.0, 3.12.4, 3.12.7 (re-enter via the public method), 3.12.8, 3.12.12 and
    3.13.14 (call `_parse_known_args2`). `requires-python` is ">=3.12" and Ubuntu
    24.04 ships 3.12.3, so the re-entering band is supported and the guard stays.
    tests/test_diff_bill.py::TestIntermixedSubParserGuard simulates the re-entering
    shape by monkeypatching, so the guard is pinned on every interpreter -- not only
    on the CI floor leg that happens to run an interpreter from that band.

    `add_subparsers(parser_class=...)` binds EVERY subparser of this parser, not only
    `compare`: a future subcommand with a `nargs=REMAINDER` positional raises
    `TypeError: parse_intermixed_args: positional arg with nargs=...` at parse time.
