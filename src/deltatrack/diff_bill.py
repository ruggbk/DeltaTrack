    **Scope, stated first because the name could be read wider than it is.** This decides
    exactly one thing: whether the similarity rule revokes a pairing ``match_nodes``
    proposed. It is not a verdict on correspondence across the whole matcher, and this
    slice does not build [ADR 0020](../../docs/decisions/0020-matching-stages.md)'s
    assignment stage. ``match_nodes`` still owns ``match_path`` grouping, division
    subgrouping, the cross-division fallback and ``_similarity_pair``'s unthresholded
    greedy claim; ``reconcile_moves`` still runs a second retrieval and assignment pass
    *after* classification. Those stay fused. What changes is that the one rule capable of
    revoking a pairing now runs before classification rather than inside it, so
    classification classifies the shape it is handed instead of deciding it.

    **The condition is transcribed, not tidied.** It is the pre-refactor expression from
    ``diff_bills``, read in the positive:

        text_changes = diff_text(old_normalized, new_normalized)
        if not text_changes:                                        -> kept

    The gate is the emptiness of a *word-level diff*, and it stays a ``diff_text`` call
    rather than becoming ``old_normalized == new_normalized``. The two agree on every one
    of the corpus's path-matched pairings, and that is not a reason to substitute one for
    the other: an agreement measured on 27 documents is not a statement about every input a
    bill can contain, and a Phase-1 extraction that swapped in a different-looking
    condition would be changing the rule while claiming to move it. The resulting repeated
    call is the visible residue of the fusion this slice does not yet remove; deleting it
    is a later change owing its own evidence.

    **A ``False`` result is final for these two observations, but not for either of them.**
    The two halves become an unmatched old and an unmatched new observation, and
    ``reconcile_moves`` may still pair each with a *different* partner. It cannot re-pair
    them with each other: a revoked pairing scores below ``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`` and the
    move pass requires ``MOVE_THRESHOLD``, over the same normalization and the same
    measure. That ordering is checked rather than assumed, because ``move_candidates``
    constructs its ``SequenceMatcher`` differently and a junk-heuristic difference between
    the two sites would not announce itself.

    The body is the ADR 0020 stage sequence, written out so stage ownership reads off the call

    later round may consult earlier matching state, but none of it may run after classification.

    Round 2 stays after :func:`apply_similarity_revocation`, and that ordering is load-bearing
    rather than incidental — 228 of the corpus's 496 selected moves touch an observation that
    exists only because the similarity rule revoked its pairing, and 145 have both sides so
    produced. Post-#591 that is a sequencing constraint inside matching, no longer a dependency
    on classification output.

    What this slice does **not** unfuse, said plainly: round 1. ``match_nodes`` still decides both
    what may be compared (``match_path`` grouping, division subgrouping, the cross-division
    fallback) and what corresponds (``_similarity_pair``'s unthresholded greedy claim), in one
    pass, and :func:`apply_similarity_revocation` still owns the rule that can revoke a pairing.

    """A subparser whose optionals may sit anywhere among its positionals.

    argparse matches positionals greedily within each run *between* optionals, so a
    variadic positional swallows the whole first run: `compare old.xml --financial
    new.xml` would fail with "unrecognized arguments: new.xml" even though the
    two-required-positional parser this replaced accepted it. Every ordering that puts a
    flag *between* the two paths would have regressed, silently, since flags-first and
    flags-last still work.

    `parse_intermixed_args` is argparse's own answer to that, but it refuses a parser
    holding subparsers, so it cannot be switched on for the top-level parser -- only
    here, where `add_subparsers` hands control to the subcommand. It delegates back into
    `parse_known_args` with the positionals suppressed; the guard lets that inner call
    through, and is inert if a future argparse stops re-entering.

    The re-entry is NOT hypothetical: on CPython 3.12.0 through 3.12.7,
    `parse_known_intermixed_args` calls the public `self.parse_known_args`, so without
    the guard this override recurses into itself until RecursionError -- every `compare`
    invocation fails, legacy two-path form included. CPython 3.12.8 refactored the
    delegation to the private `_parse_known_args2`, so the guard passes through unused
    there. Verified with `inspect.getsource` and by running `build_parser()` on CPython
    3.12.0, 3.12.4, 3.12.7 (re-enter via the public method), 3.12.8, 3.12.12 and
    3.13.14 (call `_parse_known_args2`). `requires-python` is ">=3.12" and Ubuntu
    24.04 ships 3.12.3, so the re-entering band is supported and the guard stays.
    tests/test_diff_bill.py::TestIntermixedSubParserGuard simulates the re-entering
    shape by monkeypatching, so the guard is pinned on every interpreter -- not only
    on the CI floor leg that happens to run an interpreter from that band.

    `add_subparsers(parser_class=...)` binds EVERY subparser of this parser, not only
    `compare`: a future subcommand with a `nargs=REMAINDER` positional raises
    `TypeError: parse_intermixed_args: positional arg with nargs=...` at parse time.
