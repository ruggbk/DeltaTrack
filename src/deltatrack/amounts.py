"""Dollar-amount extraction: the one primitive that reads money out of bill text.

Source-neutral by construction. It imports nothing from ``deltatrack`` and must stay that
way, because both pipelines depend on it and one of them depends on it for *observation
production* rather than for reporting.

**Why this is a module rather than a private helper in the differ.** ADR 0020 slice 1 moved
PDF block formation into ``parsers.pdf_blocks`` so that an ADR 0019 parser revision could be
derived without hashing the matcher. That left one thread uncut:
``pdf_blocks._is_strippable_heading_line`` calls :func:`extract_amounts`, and the call is
**result-bearing** — an uppercase heading with no recognised amount may be stripped from a
block body, while one carrying an amount (an all-caps ``TOTAL, …, $X`` recap line) must be
retained, so a money change is never silently dropped.

While that function lived in ``diff_bill``, a change to the regexes below could change the
emitted PDF observation sequence **without touching any file a PDF parser revision covered**.
That is exactly the failure ADR 0019 identity exists to prevent: identity must change
whenever code capable of changing the emitted observations changes. Hashing all of
``diff_bill`` would have fixed it by putting matching policy back inside observation
identity, which is the coupling slice 1 removed. Extracting the primitive is the fix that
does not trade one defect for the other.

So this module is part of the **PDF parser-revision dependency closure**:

    parsers/pdf_text.py + parsers/pdf_anchors.py + parsers/pdf_blocks.py
      + deltatrack/amounts.py + the pypdfium2 distribution version

The precedent is ``deltatrack.similarity``, extracted for the same shape of reason (#492) and
which records the rule this follows: a number or primitive lives beside its use until a
second consumer appears, and that is the moment to promote it. There are now two, and one of
them is a parser.

**Scope.** Only the extraction primitive lives here. ``match_amounts`` and its word-level
pairing stay in ``diff_bill``: they are diff machinery, only one pipeline pairs amounts
across two texts, and moving them would have widened a dependency repair into the general
#62 cleanup it is deliberately not.
