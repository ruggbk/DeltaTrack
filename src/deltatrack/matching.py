"""Data contracts for the four matching stages (ADR 0020).

ADR 0020 splits one fused decision into retrieval, identity evidence, assignment and
classification. This module holds the values that pass between them, and nothing else:
no retriever, no measure, no threshold, no orchestration. It is the vocabulary the
stages will be written against, introduced ahead of them so that moving behaviour is a
separate, byte-identical change.

**Nothing imports this yet, and that is the design.** ADR 0020's implementation rule is
to introduce the contracts behaviour-preservingly before changing matching policy, with
canonical JSON byte-identical over the committed XML corpus as the acceptance criterion
(``tests/test_canonical_baseline.py``). A slice that both defined the types and rewired
the differ could not report that criterion as evidence of anything, because the two
changes would be inseparable in the result.

The line the whole record turns on, restated here because every type below is placed by
it:

    Retrieval policy controls consideration. Assignment policy controls correspondence.

**This module imports nothing from ``deltatrack``, and a test enforces that.** It is the
mechanism behind ADR 0020's requirement that the contracts survive an unsettled PDF
observation representation: a type that cannot name a ``BillNode``, a text run or a glyph
cannot come to depend on whether a PDF observation is reconstructed from glyphs, read
from PDFium's character stream, or produced by a hybrid. An import of the engine is the
first step of that dependency, so the import graph is where it is cheapest to refuse.

## What an observation reference is, and is not

[ADR 0019](../../docs/decisions/0019-observation-identity.md) identifies a parsed
observation by ``(source_sha256, parser_revision, node_ordinal)``. Within one comparison
the first two are constant per side: every old-side observation shares one source digest
and one parser revision, likewise every new-side one. So :class:`ObservationRef` carries
only what varies — the side and the ordinal — and the document-level half of the identity
is a property of the comparison rather than of each reference.

That is a deliberate narrowing with a stated cost. A reference is meaningful **only
within the comparison that produced it**, so nothing here may be stored, compared across
runs, or written into a fixture without re-attaching the digest and the revision. ADR
0019 governs stored artifacts and says explicitly that it changes no engine runtime
behaviour; carrying a content hash of the parser on every candidate would be that change,
for a benefit no in-run consumer has.

Why not skip the ordinal and reference the node object? Because the ordinal is what makes
a candidate set inspectable, comparable between runs of the same input, and expressible
in a research artifact — the whole reason ADR 0020 wants the set materialised. It also
generalises to PDF where ``element_id`` does not.

## Rules that shape these types

- **A candidate exists once per observation pair**, however many retrievers found it.
- **Rank and score belong to a proposal, not to a candidate** — a pair proposed by two
  retrievers has no single rank, and their scores are on unrelated scales.
- **A retriever need not produce a number.** A proposal with null rank and score is
  fully valid; requiring a score pushes retrievers into inventing one, and an invented
  score is worse than an absent field because it looks comparable.
- **Proposals are provenance, not votes.** Duplicate proposals change neither candidate
  multiplicity nor assignment weight.
- **Evidence carries no correspondence verdict**, and no assignment policy.
- **Correspondence is first-class and not pair-shaped**, so a consolidation has a
  production shape to be measured against — and **every selected link carries the
  evidence that selected it**, exactly one record per link.

## Canonical form is an invariant of the type, not of one constructor

``RetrieverInvocation.config`` and ``Evidence.signals`` are name-sorted, and
``Candidate.proposals`` is ordered by ``(round, retriever, config)``, in
``__post_init__`` rather than in the ``of()`` helpers. A normalisation that only the
convenience constructor applies is not a normalisation: the ordinary dataclass
constructor stays reachable, so two spellings of one configuration would compare unequal,
and ``CandidateSet`` keys proposals by invocation — meaning a bypassed sort would
silently hold two copies of one invocation. The determinism tests would still pass,
because they would be exercising the one path that normalises.

## Deliberately absent

- Any retriever, similarity measure or threshold. Retrieval and assignment policy are
  the next slices' work; ``deltatrack.similarity`` remains the only home for a cutoff.
- The canonical projection of a non-binary correspondence. ADR 0020 settles that it
  degrades explicitly and never duplicates a side's amounts, but no producer emits a
  non-binary correspondence yet, and a projection with no caller is a rule pinned by a
  test rather than by use.
- Serialization. ADR 0020 freezes semantics, not wire format, and no consumer needs one.

    Deduplication is the whole point, and ADR 0020 warns it can fail in two opposite
