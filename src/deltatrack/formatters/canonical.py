"""Canonical diff JSON producers and the consumer that rebuilds DiffView.

The canonical JSON is the public contract for diff results — pipeline-neutral,
versioned, semantic-only (no pre-rendered HTML). See
schema/canonical-diff.md for the prose spec and schema/canonical-diff.schema.json
for the JSON Schema.

Two producers, one consumer:

  xml_diff_to_canonical(diff_dict)        -> dict   # from bill_diff_to_dict output
  pdf_diff_to_canonical(pdf_diff, **meta) -> dict   # from PdfDiff

  view_from_canonical(canonical) -> DiffView        # rebuilds renderer-facing view

view_from_canonical lets the existing HTML renderer (formatters.diff_html)
consume canonical JSON without code changes, and gives the round-trip
parity tests something to assert against.
