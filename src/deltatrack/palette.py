"""DeltaTrack's palette: the one place a colour, font, radius or shadow is decided.

Every surface DeltaTrack renders takes its values from here. The report embeds them
(`formatters/diff_html.py`), and the published examples landing page embeds a subset
(`scripts/render_examples.py`). Both *embed* rather than link, which is deliberate and
not negotiable: a report has to render with no network at all (ADR 0011), so it cannot
fetch a stylesheet, and the loading tab in `webapp/js/compare.js` is written via
`document.write` and can resolve no URLs either. "One palette" therefore means one
source generated into each surface, never one file they all link.

Keep the set to what the stylesheets actually use. An unreferenced token ships in every
report and styles nothing, which is how eleven of them accumulated with the whole suite
green (#667). `tests/test_committed_examples.py` gates that against a rendered report.

The four diff states (added, removed, modified, moved) are the vocabulary bill
comparison needs, and each carries a background and a foreground.

History: #667 took ownership of these values; #676 is the epic that made DeltaTrack's
UI its own. The values here are the report's, which is the palette DeltaTrack shipped
first; unifying the web app onto one set is tracked separately.
