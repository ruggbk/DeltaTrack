"""PDF observation identity: an ADR 0019 address bound to a block, and the parser revision.

Slice 3 of the ADR 0020 PDF convergence work
(``docs/research/pdf-matching-convergence/``). This is the PDF counterpart of
``diff_bill.Observation`` / ``diff_bill.ObservationRegistry``, plus the piece XML never
needed a runtime home for: a **derived** ADR 0019 parser revision for PDF observation
production.

**Nothing in the engine consumes this yet, and that is the design.** Slices 4-7 move
matching behaviour; introducing the representation in the same change would make every
preservation gate uninterpretable, because the two edits would be inseparable in the
result. ``deltatrack.matching`` was introduced the same way for the same reason.

## Why this module, and not ``parsers/pdf_blocks``

An observation address is a matching concept: :class:`~deltatrack.matching.ObservationRef`
lives in ``deltatrack.matching``. Defining :class:`PdfObservation` next to ``_Block`` would
therefore mean ``parsers/pdf_blocks`` importing ``deltatrack.matching`` — and the parser
revision below is a content hash over exactly the modules reachable from
``parsers.pdf_blocks``. That import would put ``matching`` back inside PDF observation
production, undoing the repair slices 1 and 1a exist to make: editing a matching threshold
would once again change observation identity and quarantine every stored artifact.

``tests/test_pdf_observation_identity.py`` demonstrates this rather than asserting it, by
injecting an import of the threshold module into ``parsers/pdf_blocks`` and showing the
revision move.

And not ``diff_pdf`` either: that module is the matcher, must stay downstream of observation
production, and is what slices 4-7 dismantle.

## Two identities that are easy to conflate, kept apart

``tests/pdf_corpus._extractor_fingerprint``
    The **page-extraction cache identity**. It answers "may this pickled ``Page`` list be
    served?", so its closure is exactly what produces a ``Page``: ``parsers/pdf_text.py``
    plus the pypdfium2 build. Editing ``pdf_anchors``, ``pdf_blocks`` or ``amounts`` cannot
    make a cached ``Page`` stale, so widening it to cover them would only force needless
    re-extraction.

:func:`pdf_parser_revision`
    The **observation parser revision**. It answers ADR 0019's question, "which parse was
    this stored judgment about?", so its closure is everything capable of changing the
    emitted observation sequence: ``pdf_text`` + ``pdf_anchors`` + ``pdf_blocks`` +
    ``amounts`` + pypdfium2.

The second contains the first. They are still separate identities with separate jobs, and
one function serving both would either invalidate the extraction cache on an irrelevant edit
or under-report the parse an artifact was derived from.

## What identity is, here

ADR 0019 keys a stored parsed observation on ``(source_sha256, parser_revision,
node_ordinal)``. Of those three, only the ordinal varies within one parse, so only the
ordinal is on the runtime address — see ``matching``'s module docstring for that argument in
full. The other two are properties of the comparison, and a consumer that stores a PDF
ordinal must re-attach them; :func:`pdf_parser_revision` is where the second comes from.

**No stored artifact is introduced here.** Nothing in this slice writes an ordinal to disk,
so the residual ADR 0019 open question 2 leaves open for PDF — emission determinism is
measured in-process only (research record §4.1) — is not yet cashed in. It becomes
load-bearing the moment a PDF ordinal is committed to a fixture, golden or labelled dataset,
and that is the point at which the cross-process check is owed. The revision itself is
cross-process stable and tested to be.

    for exactly the bytes that produce observations, committed or not, and returns to its

    everything an observation needs — ``anchor`` (kind, canonical text, page, line, division),
    ``text`` (the post-strip body the matcher compares), ``page_range`` and the underlying
    ``indexed_lines`` — so restating any of them here would create a second representation
