"""Turn two bill-XML byte blobs into canonical diff JSON or standalone HTML.

The XML counterpart to ``compare/pdf.py``. Same contract, same stateless
guarantee: uploaded XML lives only for the duration of the request (temp files
deleted before return), nothing is persisted.

    normalize_bill()       (bill_tree)            — parse XML → BillTree
    diff_bills()           (diff_bill)            — structural diff
    bill_diff_to_dict()    (diff_bill)            — diff → dict (+ financial)
    serialize_tree()       (formatters.text_serializer) — full bill text per side
    xml_diff_to_canonical()(formatters.canonical) — dict → canonical JSON
    view_from_canonical()  (formatters.canonical) — canonical → DiffView (HTML path)
    format_diff_html()     (formatters.diff_html) — HTML path (view + canonical)

The XML pipeline resolves changes structurally (no page/line coordinates), and
its full_text is gutterless paragraph flow — the renderer keys off
``versions.v2.source == "xml"`` to drop the PDF line-number gutter.

**This module is the only place a bill-XML report is assembled** (#42). The web app,
the ``diff_bill.py compare --format html`` CLI, and ``render_examples.py`` all enter
here, so one bill pair renders one way no matter which surface asked for it. Each of
those three used to assemble the canonical → view → HTML chain itself, and the copies
had already drifted apart in which version metadata they set. ``diff_pdf.py`` delegates
to ``compare/pdf.py`` for the same reason; this is the XML half of that pattern.
