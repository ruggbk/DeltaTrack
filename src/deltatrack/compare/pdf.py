# bill collapses into one anchorless block. Nothing raises: the diff "succeeds"

#
# The signal is the share of lines carrying a printed number. Swept over the 60
# local corpus PDFs long enough to be judged (>= _MIN_LINES_FOR_GUARD), the two

#                                 public-law print and a committee report
#   numbered    0.90   - 0.999    the other 46
#
# A handful of numbered lines is expected even in an unnumbered print: they are
# body-prose lines whose first token happens to be a digit ("25 percent of such
# amount…"), 14 of 3,808 in 115-hr-5895. So the test is a LOW RATIO, not zero.
# 0.5 sits in the middle of the empty gap; no real print comes near it.

# something. Load-bearing, not defensive padding: short amendment prints in the
# corpus run 0.18 - 0.43 numbered over 21-28 lines (margin numbers are simply
# sparse at that size) and the ratio alone would decline them.
#
# Set to 50, not higher, because everything under the floor is EXEMPT and so
# keeps the silent-wrong-answer behavior this guard exists to stop. The floor is
# the miss window, so it should be as low as the data allows. Across the corpus:
#
#   floor  judged  declined  min ratio among accepted
#     20     88      19 (5 false)   0.5517   <- declines real numbered prints
#     29     83      14             0.5517   <- correct, but hugs the 0.5 line
#     50     79      14             0.6607   <- same 14, comfortable margin
#    200     60      14             0.9022   <- needlessly wide miss window
#
# There is a hard cliff at 28 -> 29 lines (0.4286 -> 0.5517). 50 clears it with
# margin while declining the identical 14 documents.
#
# RESIDUAL: an unnumbered document under 50 lines (~1.5 pages) is still exempt
# and will still diff to one anchorless block. Accepted deliberately — at that
# size a single-block diff is close to the whole document anyway, so it misleads
