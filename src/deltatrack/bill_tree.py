    that hid a $4.93B/$1.91B/$0.25B rescission collapsing to $1.00B/$0.98B.

    Reading the whole section is also what keeps the two money views from disagreeing.
    ``amount_text`` reaches for ``display_text`` because this function used to truncate
    (#365); with the truncation gone the two renderings carry the same amounts, which is
    the invariant tests/test_financial_diff.py now pins rather than the old gap.
