"""FastAPI service exposing the DeltaTrack PDF diff engine.

Stateless by design: uploaded PDFs live only for the duration of a request (in a
temp dir deleted immediately by ``compare_pdfs``), nothing is persisted, and the
result is returned to the caller. No analytics, no per-client logging — this
honors the "your session is not tracked" promise shown in the UI.

The single interactive endpoint is ``POST /api/compare``: upload a start PDF and
an end PDF, get back a standalone HTML diff report (default) or canonical JSON
(``?output=json``).
