"""Shared recall logic for committee-report validation (GitHub #8).

Both the test (tests/test_validate_extraction.py) and the report generator
(scripts/generate_validation_report.py) call `validate_jurisdiction` so they report the
same numbers. An account is "validated" when the committee-recommended amount the report
states is found in the parser's extraction from the bill XML, either:
  - as a single token under the correct top-level agency (`match_path[0]`), or
  - as a sum of components of the account's mapped node (account totals the bill itemizes).

Amounts that match neither are the residual: they are inherent report-vs-bill structural
differences (indefinite "such sums" accounts, totals stated only as parts, occasional
report typos), not parser errors — see docs/parser-validation.md.
