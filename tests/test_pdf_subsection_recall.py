"""Precision/recall parity gate for run-in subsection anchors (DeltaTrack#96).

A regex-INDEPENDENT oracle: a raw-XML extractor over ``<section>/<subsection enum>``,
written fresh here because ``bill_tree`` collapses subsections into the section's text
and exposes no per-subsection node/enum. From it:

- **Precision** (``test_precision_no_false_subsections``): every PDF-detected
  ``(section, enum)`` must be a real, NON-quoted XML subsection. Precision-first —
  measured 0 false positives on the appropriations fixtures, 2 on the messy 119-hr-1
  (documented residue below).
- **Recall** (``test_every_catchline_subsection_is_found``): the denominator is the true
  catchline-bearing subsection set — a subsection with a non-empty ``<header>`` OR whose
  ``<text>`` opens with the run-in pattern — built WITH the same roman-reject the PDF
  uses, and with quoted-block subsections EXCLUDED (they self-exclude on the PDF side
  too). Every member of that set must be detected; there is no tolerance and no
  allowlist.
- **Quoted-block leak** (``test_no_quoted_block_leak``): the PDF must detect ZERO
  subsections that live inside a ``<quoted-block>`` amendment (they render with GPO's
  ``‘‘`` and self-exclude). Measured 0 on 119-hr-1 (numbered, quote-heavy: 177 quoted
  subsections). The `<header>` element is inconsistently applied across bills, so it is
  NOT a usable denominator on its own — hence the header-OR-inline union above.

Both properties are asserted ABSOLUTELY (#473). Recall admits nothing: every
catchline-bearing subsection must be found on every fixture. Precision admits exactly one
named shape, below. Neither is a ratio, because a percentage on these fixtures says
something different on each one — 2% of 119-hr-1's 934 subsections is about 18 losses,
while 2% of 118-hr-8752's 3 is less than one — so the same constant was simultaneously
too loose to protect the big bill and unable to describe the small ones.

    fixture      false positives  missed   (measured 2026-08-04)
    118-hr-8752        0            0
    117-hr-4502        0            0
    119-hr-1           2            0

Recall carried 5 misses on 119-hr-1 until #473. They were subsections whose catchline
wrapped past the parser's continuation window, so the longest-titled provisions in the
bill were the ones silently dropped; widening the window
(``pdf_anchors._RUNIN_MAX_CONTINUATIONS``) recovered all 5 and 5 more on fixtures this
module does not parametrize. Nothing was left for a tolerance to hold, which is why the
conversion needed no allowlist.

Precision residue, still open (on 119-hr-1, NOT chased — needs the leveled tree, out of
#96 scope): doubled two-letter enumerators ``(aa)``/``(bb)`` that are a DEEPER-level
(paragraph/clause) run-in, mis-emitted at subsection level (2 of 936). The two-letter
doubled-enum rule can't tell a 27th subsection from a deep-list continuation without the
leveled tree (#54/#108). The precision test pins that every false positive is such a
two-letter enum — a single-letter FP would be a NEW class and fails loud. That shape
assertion, not a percentage, is what bounds the residue.

# NOT match a cross-REFERENCE to a section, which carries no such period and is ordinary
# catchline vocabulary — 119-hr-1 has a real one, "(b) TREATMENT OF QUALIFIED PRODUCTION
# PROPERTY AS SECTION 1245 PROPERTY". Requiring the period is what separates "this anchor

# (a join walking prose that carries an early period-dash) though not present here.
#
# It is NOT a tuning knob, and it is deliberately far above the data rather than fitted to
# it. The longest real catchline is 258 chars (119-hr-1 sec. 112207(b)); with the shape rule
# disabled the fabrications measure 136, 146, 256, 284, 295, 295, 874, 874, 874, so they

# of 934 catchline-bearing subsections, of which 5 were actually spent, so roughly 13 more
# could stop being found with this module still green. On the other two fixtures, which
# carry 3 and 8 subsections, the same floor could not absorb even one loss, so the entire
# tolerance lived on one bill and the number meant something different on every fixture.
#
# The 5 that were spent were not irreducible residue: they were subsections whose catchline
# wrapped past the parser's continuation window, fixed in #473 by widening it. Nothing is
# left for a tolerance to hold, so there is no allowlist here either. A subsection that
# stops being found is a regression, and this module now says so in one case rather than
# leaving it to erode a percentage.
