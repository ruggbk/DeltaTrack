"""Precision/recall parity gate for run-in subsection anchors (DeltaTrack#96).

A regex-INDEPENDENT oracle: a raw-XML extractor over ``<section>/<subsection enum>``,
written fresh here because ``bill_tree`` collapses subsections into the section's text
and exposes no per-subsection node/enum. From it:

- **Precision** (``test_precision_no_false_subsections``): every PDF-detected
  ``(section, enum)`` must be a real, NON-quoted XML subsection. Precision-first —
  measured 0 false positives on the appropriations fixtures, 2 on the messy 119-hr-1
  (documented residue below).
- **Recall** (``test_every_catchline_subsection_is_found``): the denominator is the true
  catchline-bearing subsection set — a subsection with a non-empty ``<header>`` OR whose
  ``<text>`` opens with the run-in pattern — built WITH the same roman-reject the PDF
  uses, and with quoted-block subsections EXCLUDED (they self-exclude on the PDF side
  too). Every member of that set must be detected; there is no tolerance and no
  allowlist.
- **Quoted-block leak** (``test_no_quoted_block_leak``): the PDF must detect ZERO
  subsections that live inside a ``<quoted-block>`` amendment (they render with GPO's
  ``‘‘`` and self-exclude). Measured 0 on 119-hr-1 (numbered, quote-heavy: 177 quoted
  subsections). The `<header>` element is inconsistently applied across bills, so it is
  NOT a usable denominator on its own — hence the header-OR-inline union above.

Both properties are asserted ABSOLUTELY (#473). Recall admits nothing: every
catchline-bearing subsection must be found on every fixture. Precision admits exactly one
named shape, below. Neither is a ratio, because a percentage on these fixtures says
something different on each one — 2% of 119-hr-1's 934 subsections is about 18 losses,
while 2% of 118-hr-8752's 3 is less than one — so the same constant was simultaneously
too loose to protect the big bill and unable to describe the small ones.

The document set is DERIVED, not hand-listed (#488). Every committed PDF with a
same-version XML beside it is a usable pair, and for most of this module's life three
were named. That was not a judgement about the rest: two of the six fabricated anchors
found while reviewing #473 sat on documents this module did not read, and no tolerance
could have caught them because the files were never opened. The corpus has since grown
to 24 such pairs, which is the point — the derived list picked all of them up on the
rebase that introduced them, and the coverage guard below required each to be measured
and recorded before this module would go green again. Hand
maintenance is the failure mode, so ``_discover_pairs`` walks the corpus and ``EXPECTED``
records what each document should do. A pair with no entry still runs, and
``test_expectations_cover_every_committed_pair`` fails until someone records it — the
same two-lists-pinned-to-each-other idiom as
``test_pipeline_parity.test_band_table_covers_every_parity_bill``.

``EXPECTED`` is that table: one entry per document, recording the oracle's two
denominators and any false positive on record. It is not duplicated in prose here,
because a copy of it in this docstring would be a second list to keep in step, which is
the failure this change exists to remove.

Two documents are not ordinary members, and both are asserted rather than excluded:

- ``115-hr-5895/5_enrolled-bill.pdf`` yields no anchors at all. Enrolled prints carry no
  GPO margin line numbers, so the anchor pipeline declines the document rather than
  guessing (#141). Under this module's zero-tolerance recall that reads as 36 of 36
  missed, which would be a false alarm. It is recorded as ``anchors=False`` and gets
  ``test_declined_layout_yields_no_subsection_anchors`` instead: the decline is asserted
  positively, so a document that starts producing anchors fails just as loudly as one
  that stops. (``test_corpus_tree_properties`` owns the wider class registry and the
  text-layer-is-still-whole property; this module asserts only the subsection view.)
- Several documents genuinely have zero catchline-bearing subsections. Some carry no
  subsections at all (113-hr-3547's House prints, 118-hr-2882); more tellingly,
  ``117-hr-4432/1_reported-in-house.pdf`` carries 74 subsections and not one of them
  bears a catchline. That is the case a bare anti-vacuity floor cannot express: "no
  subsections of this shape exist" and "the extractor returned nothing" are identical to a
  ``>= MIN_CATCHLINES`` guard. So the floor was replaced by an exact per-document pin of
  the oracle's count (see ``EXPECTED``), which distinguishes the two by construction.

Recall carried 5 misses on 119-hr-1 until #473. They were subsections whose catchline
wrapped past the parser's continuation window, so the longest-titled provisions in the
bill were the ones silently dropped; widening the window
(``pdf_anchors._RUNIN_MAX_CONTINUATIONS``) recovered all 5 and 5 more on fixtures this
module does not parametrize. Nothing was left for a tolerance to hold, which is why the
conversion needed no allowlist.

Precision residue, still open (on 119-hr-1, NOT chased — needs the leveled tree, out of
#96 scope): doubled two-letter enumerators ``(aa)``/``(bb)`` that are a DEEPER-level
(paragraph/clause) run-in, mis-emitted at subsection level (2 of 936). The two-letter
doubled-enum rule can't tell a 27th subsection from a deep-list continuation without the
leveled tree (#54/#108). The precision test pins that every false positive is such a
two-letter enum — a single-letter FP would be a NEW class and fails loud. That shape
assertion, not a percentage, is what bounds the residue.

    ``catchlines`` is an EXACT pin on the XML oracle's denominator, not a floor. It
    replaces the old ``MIN_CATCHLINES = 3`` guard, which existed to stop the gates passing
    vacuously on a broken extractor (#167) but could not admit a document that genuinely
    has none — 113-hr-3547's engrossed Senate amendment, which is all quoted-block
    material. A floor cannot tell "this bill has no subsections of this shape" from "the
    oracle returned nothing"; an exact count per committed, byte-fixed XML can, and it
    also catches the denominator shrinking on the big fixtures, which a floor of 3 never
    would. It moves only when the oracle or a fixture is deliberately changed.

    ``false_positives`` is self-cleaning, like ``KNOWN_UNCOVERED_AMOUNTS`` in
    ``tests/test_corpus_properties.py``: an entry that stops being a false positive is a
    fixed defect, and leaving it here would let the gate keep tolerating a closed hole.

    ``subsections`` is the same kind of pin on the oracle's OTHER denominator, every
    non-quoted ``<section>/<subsection>`` pair. This module does not use it as a
    denominator, but ``test_xml_subsection_nodes`` does, and that module reads its
    document list from here — so one table records what a document is and one guard test
    keeps it honest, rather than two lists that can disagree about the same corpus.

    """A subsection anchor's TEXT is a catchline, never a run into the next section (#473).

    Swept over every committed PDF, because this is the one property the three gates above
    are structurally unable to see. They compare ``(section, enum)`` pair identity and
    never look at the anchor's text, so an anchor sitting at the right position with a
    295-character garbage label is invisible to all of them — and the label is consumed
    output: it becomes the node label and the breadcrumb a reader is shown.

    That is not hypothetical. Following a wrapped catchline by line COUNT alone made the
    join walk out of six catchline-less subsections, across an account heading and a
    ``SEC.`` line, onto the following section's ``.—``. Precision, recall and the
    quoted-block gate all stayed green throughout, which is why this one is written
    against the text.

    Two absolute assertions, no ratio: a catchline never contains a section heading, and it
    is bounded in length. The heading rule does the work; the length cap is an unexercised
    backstop (see MAX_CATCHLINE_CHARS).
