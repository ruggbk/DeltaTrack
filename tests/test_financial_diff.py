        The floor matters as much as the assertion: an ``unchanged`` entry is only
        checkable if some pair produces ``unchanged`` entries at all, and a gate that
        cannot tell "fixed" from "nothing to check" is not a gate.

        KNOWN BLIND SPOT, stated here rather than left to be discovered: this compares
        what the two sides of a comparison EXPOSE, so it cannot see a drop that happens
        identically on both sides. `_process_section_element` takes a different path for
        a section with ``appropriations-*`` children and builds its node from the opening
        <text> alone, dropping any <list> / <continuation-text> / <quoted-block> sibling
        from every node in both renderings -- 8 money-bearing instances on this corpus.
        Both versions truncate the same way, so the amounts always agree and this passes.
        Tracked in #459; closing it wants a gate that compares node amounts against the
        source XML rather than against the other side.
