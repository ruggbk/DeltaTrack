"""The fixture-layout invariants the two-tree split rests on (#308).

Splitting committed fixtures (``tests/corpus/``) from the downloaded working corpus
(``bills/``) removed the ``.gitignore`` re-admit list, and with it the failure that list
caused. It also created three new ways to be quietly wrong, none of which any existing
gate would notice, because each fails by making a test *read the wrong tree* rather than
by raising:

1. **A stale ``bills/<id>`` path for a committed fixture.** It resolves on a developer
   machine that has downloaded that bill, and is simply absent in CI — where the test
   skips (most of these guards are skip-if-absent) and the run stays green. This comes
   in two spellings, and the second is the one that bites: the bill id beside the word
   ``bills``, and a download ROOT bound once and composed with a bill id far away
   (``_BILLS = _ROOT / "bills"``). Only the first is greppable per bill, so each has its
   own rule.
2. **A sweep that no longer spans both trees.** ``CORPUS_SWEEP=1`` is exploratory, so
   nothing asserts its case count; narrowing it to one tree loses coverage silently.
3. **A fixture written into ``tests/corpus/`` but never staged.** The manifest floor
   catches manifested bills; the golden modules pin files the manifest does not name.

The judgement throughout is per VERSION, not per bill: a bill is routinely committed for
the stages a gate pins and download-only for the rest, so a bill-level waiver silently
waives its committed siblings too.

Each rule below also proves it can fire, against a synthetic bad input — a layout gate
that has never once gone red cannot distinguish "the layout is right" from "the check is
broken". ``test_every_fixture_file_is_tracked_by_git`` is the exception: its fault has to
be injected on disk (an unstaged file), so it is verified by hand rather than in-process.

Which files the rules see is itself derived rather than listed (#654). The roster of
directories this replaced was enumerated, so a directory that moved dropped out of the
scan and one that was never listed was exempt from every rule the day it was created,
with nothing to show for either. Proving the RULES fire says nothing about that; the
scan is covered separately, by a control that pins the discovered set exactly against a
synthetic repository, plus a bound on what the exclusion list may ever remove.

    was never listed was exempt from every rule below the day it was created — with the
    suite green throughout. #367 moved ``shared/``/``server/``/``bill_index/`` and the
    roster kept their old paths; #398 moved the engine to ``src/deltatrack`` while the
    roster still named the old top-level packages, leaving the scan covering zero engine
    files; #424 was the same shape again for ``tools/``. Measured before this change: a
    package at ``src/sibling_pkg/`` holding a committed fixture addressed through
    ``bills/`` left the module at 20 passed, while the identical line under ``scripts/``
    failed — same content, opposite verdicts, decided only by the directory.

    Membership comes from git because the contract is *scan everything a clean CI
    checkout receives*. That is exactly what git tracks: it excludes local-only noise by
    construction rather than by a deny-list somebody has to maintain (measured on one
    machine: ``.claude/`` held 3348 ``.py`` in nested worktrees, each a full copy of this
    repository, and ``.venv/`` 1886 — and a conventionally named ``venv/`` or ``build/``
    carries no leading dot to catch it). It is also the source of truth the fixture
    floors in this suite already use. No claim is made here about pre-commit, which runs
    ruff and ruff-format and no pytest.

    Both failure modes are loud, because a scan that cannot enumerate its own inputs
    cannot police anything and a shrunken one passes every rule vacuously:

    * git cannot answer -> raise. ``uncommitted_bill_files`` degrades gracefully instead,
      citing an unpacked sdist, but that venue cannot reach this module: the sdist in
      ``pyproject.toml`` deliberately omits ``tests/`` and the fixtures ("an sdist cannot
      run the suite. Anyone who needs that clones the repository"). So the fallback would
      serve only a broken environment, where silence is the one unacceptable outcome.
    * a tracked path is missing from the working tree -> raise, naming it. ``git
      ls-files`` reports the INDEX, so a file deleted without staging the deletion is
      still listed. Filtering those out with ``is_file()`` is the tempting repair and it
      silently shrinks the scan, which is this issue in miniature.
