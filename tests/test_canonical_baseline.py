"""Canonical XML diff output is pinned byte for byte over the committed XML corpus.

ADR 0020 makes the staged-matching extraction conditional on one acceptance criterion:
the canonical JSON must stay byte-identical while the stages are separated. This is the
XML half of it, and the claim it supports is exactly this wide:

    A matching-policy change that affects one of the committed XML corpus pairs will
    move this baseline.

Not "any matching-policy change moves a byte". A change reachable only by an input the
corpus does not contain stays green here, and the corpus bounds the *observed* input
space rather than the space the matcher accepts. That is the general limit of a
corpus gate, and it is why this sits alongside the ADR's other requirement — that a
matching-policy change carry independent precision and recall evidence — rather than
standing in for it.

What it does buy is that a refactor claiming to change nothing cannot also change
something on twelve real bills without saying so.

**What it runs.** Every adjacent version pair of the committed manifest
(``tests/corpus_manifest.toml``), through ``compare.xml.compare_xml`` — the public
canonical producer the web app calls, not a chain reassembled here. Measuring at the
consumed output is the point: a gate that re-implemented the parse → diff → serialize
composition could stay green while production's composition changed.

**Why a digest and not the JSON.** The manifest pairs serialize to roughly 22 MB, which
is not a reviewable committed artifact. A SHA-256 over the sorted-key serialization
answers the only question asked — did any byte move — and cannot be satisfied by
coincidence. The summary counts beside it assert nothing the digest does not; they exist
so a failure reads "modified 812 → 790" instead of "two hex strings differ", which is
the difference between a diagnosis and a bisect.

**What was already guarded, and what this adds.** ``test_committed_examples`` re-renders
the committed example reports and so already reddens on a matching change — but it
covers three pairs across two bills, compares rendered HTML rather than the canonical
contract, and its remedy line reads "regenerate the examples", which invites
regeneration as the fix for a signal that is not about the examples at all. This runs
every adjacent manifested pair, asserts at the layer ADR 0020 names, and attributes a
failure to the bill and the counts that moved. Measured on this branch: disabling
``_match_collision_group``'s cross-division fallback reddens both, but only this gate
names 115-hr-5895, 117-hr-4502 and 114-hr-2029 as affected.

**The self-reference, stated rather than assumed.** The expected values are produced by
the code under test, so regenerating them makes any change look intended. Three things
keep that from being free. Regeneration is opt-in (``UPDATE_BASELINE=1``), so it cannot
happen as a side effect of a normal run. The rewritten file lands in the diff, where a
reviewer sees which pairs moved. And ADR 0020 requires independent precision and recall
evidence in the pull request that changes matching policy, so a baseline update with no
such evidence is the review signal, not a formality.

To regenerate after an INTENTIONAL canonical-output change, then review the JSON diff:

    UPDATE_BASELINE=1 uv run pytest tests/test_canonical_baseline.py

Regeneration is all-or-nothing: a missing fixture refuses the write rather than
committing a baseline that silently covers fewer pairs (the shape #296 closed for the
PDF extraction golden).

**Scope: this is the XML extraction baseline.** ADR 0020 eventually requires
behaviour-preserving extraction on both pipelines, and a PDF baseline is owed before any
PDF-side stage extraction happens. None happens here, and the PDF observation contract is
intentionally unsettled meanwhile — ADR 0019's open question 2 records its emission
determinism as unmeasured — so pinning its bytes now would fire on that track's expected
changes rather than on a matching regression.
