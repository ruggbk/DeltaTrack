"""Slice 4: PDF round 2 as four stages, running before classification.

Round 2 runs before classification, through ``pdf_unmatched_population`` ->
``retrieve_pdf_move_candidates`` -> ``pdf_move_evidence`` -> ``assign_pdf_moves``. Classification
consumes settled correspondence and decides nothing about what corresponds, which is the ADR 0020
property this module binds: a change to what classification emits cannot change what matching
considered.

What this module owns:

``test_round_2_addresses_the_complete_parser_sequence``
    every address entering round 2 is a complete-sequence ordinal, ADR 0019's hazard at the one
    place round 2 mints new addresses.
``test_round_2_selection_competes_and_claims_exclusively``
    assignment orders by descending ``(similarity, ri, ai)`` and claims one-to-one. The only
    off-corpus owner of either half.
``test_assignment_can_refuse_what_retrieval_admitted`` / ``..._withhold_...``
    retrieval's bound and assignment's threshold are separate inputs.
``test_a_settled_move_carries_the_evidence_that_selected_it``
    every selected link carries exactly one evidence record, through to classification.
``test_the_corpus_actually_exercises_round_2``
    the floor that stops the corpus sweeps agreeing vacuously on a corpus with no moves.

Whole-output preservation is owned by ``tests/test_pdf_canonical_baseline.py``.

History: until #659 this module carried a rebuild of the pre-slice-4 ``diff_pdfs`` and compared
production's whole hunk stream and round-2 population against it. That answered whether slice 4
preserved behaviour, a closed question, and could not survive a deliberate change to PDF matching
policy without a fresh transcription. Its one uncovered remainder is the six ``compare.pdf``
declines, which no user reaches and no baseline record covers.

The record's §7.4 note — that PDF's move records land where the removal was, rather than
appended as in XML — is why ``PdfSettledCorrespondence`` carries a slot.
