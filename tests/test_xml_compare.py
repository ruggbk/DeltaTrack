"""Tests for the engine's XML compare wrap (compare/xml.py).

Mirrors test_pdf_compare's slow end-to-end layer: runs the real engine on the
committed HR4366 sample XMLs and validates the result. Those XMLs are in the
corpus manifest (committed to git), so this runs in CI; the skip guard only
covers a partial checkout that is missing them.

    same bytes the pipeline produced. That is the separation stated as something
    checkable -- a renderer reaching for anything outside the document could not

    show up here as a diff.

    The heading travels alongside as the second argument, which is the acceptance
    shape (``format_diff_html(canonical, title)``); the XML path derives it from the
    parsed bill rather than from the document.

    Scoped to the XML path deliberately. The PDF path also hands the renderer a
    second, print-faithful document (``display_canonical``), so its report is not yet
    a function of one document and cannot satisfy this. Extending this gate to PDF
    is what closes the remaining half of #653.
