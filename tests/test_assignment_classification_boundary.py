"""The boundary this slice creates: classification classifies, and decides nothing.

One architectural property became true in ``diff_bill``:

    Classification no longer thresholds or revokes a provisional ``(old, new)`` pairing.

Two tests carry that, and they are not interchangeable.

**The behavioural one is the contract.** ``test_classification_preserves_the_shape_it_
receives`` says classification is a length-preserving, order-preserving, side-preserving
map from decided pairings to change records. That single statement refuses all five ways
classification could touch correspondence -- splitting one pairing into two and joining two
into one both move the length, while dropping a side, inventing one and substituting a
different observation each surface as a mismatch at the pairing's own index. It stays true
however the code is later reorganised, which is what makes it the durable one.

**The source-level one is a tripwire, not a proof.** ``test_classification_body_names_no_
correspondence_cutoff`` catches exactly one regression: someone re-inlining the cutoff into
``diff_bills``. A future classification could call some other helper that changes
correspondence and satisfy it. It is kept because it names the offending line, and because
it costs nothing -- not because it establishes the architecture.

**Retired in #659: the transcriptions and everything that consumed them.** This module used to
carry the pre-refactor revocation decision as it stood at ``97f91ba``, and a transcription of
the whole pre-slice-2 pipeline from the pairing seam onward -- change records, filtered sides,
move candidates, selected links, reconciliation -- together with the corpus comparisons run
against them and the guards that kept them independent of the stages they checked. The commit
that removed them names each one.

They answered whether the extraction preserved behaviour. That question is closed, and after a
legitimate change to matching policy the comparisons fail by construction -- keeping them means
transcribing a new "before" each time, which is the burden ADR 0020's closure removes. What
survives is what is still true after such a change: the shape contract, the threshold split,
the assignment policy pins, the ADR 0019 addressing tests, and the record-order gates. Whole
output is owned by ``tests/test_canonical_baseline.py``, and round-1 correspondence by
``tests/test_round1_pairing_sentinel.py``.

``migrated_stages`` stays. It was inventoried as oracle machinery, and it is not: it calls the
real production stages in the real order and keeps each intermediate, so a control that
perturbs one is seen exactly as ``diff_bills`` would see it. Five retained tests read it.

**Element identity is checked here by ``element_id``**, which is traceability information
and not ADR 0019 observation identity. It is used only to ask "is this the same node the
pairing named", within one run, where the parse on both sides is the same object graph.
Nothing is stored, and no ordinal is derived from it.
