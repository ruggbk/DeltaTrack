"""The boundary this slice creates: classification classifies, and decides nothing.

One architectural property became true in ``diff_bill``:

    Classification no longer thresholds or revokes a provisional ``(old, new)`` pairing.

Two tests carry that, and they are not interchangeable.

**The behavioural one is the contract.** ``test_classification_preserves_the_shape_it_
receives`` says classification is a length-preserving, order-preserving, side-preserving
map from decided pairings to change records. That single statement refuses all five ways
classification could touch correspondence -- splitting one pairing into two and joining two
into one both move the length, while dropping a side, inventing one and substituting a
different observation each surface as a mismatch at the pairing's own index. It stays true
however the code is later reorganised, which is what makes it the durable one.

**The source-level one is a tripwire, not a proof.** ``test_classification_body_names_no_
correspondence_cutoff`` catches exactly one regression: someone re-inlining the cutoff into
``diff_bills``. A future classification could call some other helper that changes
correspondence and satisfy it. It is kept because it names the offending line, and because
it costs nothing -- not because it establishes the architecture.

**Why an apparently duplicated rule lives here.** ``legacy_pairing_was_revoked`` is a
transcription of the pre-refactor decision, taken from ``diff_bill.diff_bills`` as it stood
at ``97f91ba`` (the classification loop's ``diff_text`` / ``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD``
branch). It exists to disagree with production. An oracle that asked the extracted helper
what the rule is could not detect that the extraction changed it, which is the one failure
this slice can actually have -- so this must never be replaced by a call to
``pairing_survives_similarity_rule``, and production must never import it. It composes the
same primitives (``_normalize_text``, ``diff_text``, ``text_similarity``,
``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD``) deliberately: what it guards is the *composition* -- an inverted
comparison, a dropped gate, a reordered branch, the wrong constant. The primitives have
their own tests, and the canonical baseline covers the composite.

**Element identity is checked here by ``element_id``**, which is traceability information
and not ADR 0019 observation identity. It is used only to ask "is this the same node the
pairing named", within one run, where the parse on both sides is the same object graph.
Nothing is stored, and no ordinal is derived from it.

#
# Transcribed from `src/deltatrack/diff_bill.py` at `58816c1`, the base this slice was cut
# from, where `diff_bills` ran a four-branch classification loop and then called
# `reconcile_moves` over its output. The matching source at that commit is byte-identical to
# `422ad69`, the SHA the audit was performed at.
#
# Independent by construction, and for the same reason `legacy_pairing_was_revoked` is: an
# oracle that asked the new stages what they do could not detect that the extraction changed
# them, which is the one failure this slice can actually have. So none of the functions below
# may call `unmatched_population`, `retrieve_move_candidates`, `move_correspondence_evidence`,
# `assign_moves`, `settle_correspondences` or `classify`, production must never import them,
# and `test_the_slice_2_oracle_is_independent_of_the_new_stages` enforces the first half by
# reading this module's own AST.
#
# It composes the same leaf primitives deliberately (`diff_text`, `move_candidates`,
# `amount_text`, `NodeDiff`): what it guards is the COMPOSITION -- a dropped branch, an
# inverted comparison, a reordered append, the wrong field on a rebuilt record. `_normalize_text`
# is transcribed rather than imported because it is one line and the composition includes which
# text gets normalized.
