"""Tests for the full-bill tracked-changes view + Changes/Full toggle.

The renderer takes one canonical document and builds its own view from it

carrying full text gets the toggle, the full-bill pane and the embed; a document
without it (metadata only) renders the change cards alone, which the

    Two separate rules, and conflating them is a live regression risk. The

    was rendered from, which is what makes a standalone report self-describing
    and what the export hands to a reader.

    Gating the embed on `_has_full_bill` looks like a tidy-up — it stops shipping
    bytes the in-report features would not read — and silently drops the document
    from every report built from a canonical without full text. Neither committed
    example can catch that, because both carry full text, so this test owns it.
