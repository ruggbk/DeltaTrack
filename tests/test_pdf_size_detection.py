"""Size-based heading detection: band derivation + position classification (#89).

These use SYNTHETIC glyph sizes to exercise the classifier/position logic in
isolation. They are NOT the proof that real PDFs produce the bands (that is
tests/test_pdf_text.py::TestPageGlyphSizes) nor the end-to-end fix (that is the
FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE test in test_pdf_anchor_golden.py). Since #114 the size
path is the ONLY producer of account anchors — there is no text-trigger fallback
behind it — so a case that omits glyph sizes asserts the degraded TITLE/SEC.

    """Slice C of the #54 leveled-heading tree (DeltaTrack#105).

    A *major* (``appropriations-major``: DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT…, GENERAL
    PROVISIONS) is the department/division heading GPO prints at BODY size +
    ALL-CAPS directly under a ``TITLE`` line and ABOVE the heading band. It is the
    level above the carry-over agency, completing TITLE > major > agency > account.

    Load-bearing invariant (verified on 118-hr-8752 / 118-s-4795): majors render at
    BODY size while agencies/accounts render in the disjoint HEADING band. A major
    is therefore the contiguous run of body-size all-caps heading lines IMMEDIATELY
    following a TITLE; the run stops at the first heading-band line (agency/account),
    body prose line, or SEC. line. The "immediately after TITLE" structural gate is
    what separates a real major from a body-size all-caps SEC.-catchline fragment, a
    statutory-citation wrap (``U.S.C. 279)).``), or a body-size grouping header
    (``SPENDING REDUCTION ACCOUNT`` mid-title) — none of which sit right after a
    TITLE. These synthetic fixtures mirror the real 118-hr-8752 shapes (3-line
