"""ADR 0020's invariants, made executable against the contract types.

Every case below names the invariant it enforces and the bad implementation that makes
it fail. That second half is the filter: ADR 0020 asks for enforcement tests shown
capable of failing, and warns that invariant 1 in particular can fail in two opposite
directions — deduplicating too eagerly drops a proposal's metadata, not deduplicating
lets one pair reach assignment twice — so a test asserting only "one candidate reached
assignment" passes in the first case. Both directions are covered here.

What is deliberately *not* here: any assertion about a retriever, a measure, a threshold
or a stage boundary. None exists yet. A test that mocked one would be pinning a design
this slice has not committed to.
