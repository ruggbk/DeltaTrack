"""Watermark-robustness of PDF text extraction (issue #54) — spec + benign-case proof.

Draft bills circulate as watermarked PDFs and are the actual product input, but we
cannot obtain or store a real one (sensitive, and this is a public repo). A watermark
falls into one of two buckets for *text* extraction:

  1. Outside the text layer (image/graphic/annotation). pypdfium2 ignores it. This is
     the only kind we have real evidence of: the watermarked Senate copy `s4795`
     extracts 100% clean, asserted below and in `test_pdf_xml_amount_recall`.
  2. Selectable text in the page content stream (e.g. a diagonal "DRAFT" stamp). This
     interleaves with body lines and would pollute the diff.

We deliberately do NOT implement stripping for bucket 2. We have no evidence real drafts
use a text-layer watermark, and no way to know its angle or style, so a detector would be
fit to a guessed example — and a rotation-based attempt was found to collide with the GPO
production watermark and risk over-stripping landscape tables. The bucket-2 tests below
are therefore `xfail`: they pin the failure mode as an executable spec and will flip to
XPASS if stripping is ever implemented (revisit with a real draft sample). See the #54
discussion and plans/test-coverage-gaps.md.
