"""Parity gate: govinfo enumeration reproduces the on-disk corpus filenames (#10).

The #10 migration made BILLSTATUS date the single version-ordering authority and the
govinfo version code the naming authority. That legitimately renamed corpus files
(``4_reported-to-senate`` -> ``4_reported-in-senate``; 115-hr-1625 enrolled ``7_`` ->
``6_`` once the url-less Engrossed-Amendment-House phantom is excluded from the count).
This gate locks that alignment: every version filename already on disk must be one
govinfo enumeration would produce *today*, so a future ordering/naming change can't
leave the corpus pinned to stale names that then silently mis-key the property gates.

Live BILLSTATUS fetch per bill, so it is ``slow`` + ``network``: skipped by default, run
with ``pytest --run-network -m slow``. It fetches BILLSTATUS directly rather than reading
a cache so it validates the *current* live enumeration, not a snapshot that could drift
with it.

The ``network`` marker replaced REQUIRE_CORPUS=1 in #278: the requirement is a network,
which no fixture scheme can supply, and the marker says that where the env var did not.

WHY THIS RUNS ON A SCHEDULE AND NOT AFTER A DOWNLOAD (#342). The obvious automation —
fetch the corpus, then check it — is vacuous, and it fails GREEN. ``fetch_bills`` names
each file from the same ``enumerate_versions`` call this gate compares against, so
download-then-check compares a value with itself and would pass every run forever,
including the run where the naming actually changed. The gate carries information only
against filenames chosen EARLIER: the committed fixtures, whose names were frozen in git
when each bill was fetched. Hence a schedule over the committed set, and no download step.

# The COMPARISON still walks everything in bills/, not just the manifest. In automation
# that is exactly the committed set; on a machine with bills downloaded it also checks
