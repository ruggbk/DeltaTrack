"""Validate extracted bill amounts against externally-sourced ground truth.

This catches bugs in amount extraction, node assignment, and tree structure that
internal-only tests cannot detect. Two jurisdictions, two external sources:

- **Legislative Branch** (`TestLegBranchValidation`): dollar amounts extracted from
  enrolled bill XML compared against a hand-curated appropriations spreadsheet covering
  FY2014-FY2020 across 7 bills and both chambers. Validates node-level structure: each
  curated account names a `match_path`, and the parser must produce a node there with the
  expected amount.

- **Committee-report jurisdictions** (`test_report_amounts_recalled`, parameterized):
  committee-recommendation amounts parsed from each FY2025 Senate Appropriations committee
  report compared against amounts the parser extracts from the reported bill XML. This is
  the breadth probe for GitHub #8 (is the parser overfit to Legislative Branch?). It is
  amount-recall under the correct agency (or as a sum of an account's components), not a
  hand-aligned `match_path`, because the report and the XML use different naming. Most
  jurisdictions are read from the report's 3-line summary blocks; tabular jurisdictions
  (Defense) are read from the comparative statement instead (in thousands). See
  validation_sources.py and validation_check.validate_jurisdiction.

#
# The parser's extraction from each reported bill XML is validated against the committee
# report (external ground truth). An account is validated when its committee-recommended
# amount appears under the correct agency, or as a sum of the mapped node's components
# (see validation_check.validate_jurisdiction). The unvalidated remainder is inherent
# report-vs-bill structural difference (indefinite accounts, totals stated only as parts,
# report typos), documented and quantified in docs/parser-validation.md.
#
# Maintainability: rather than hand-curate a per-account rationale list (which conscripts
# whoever owns it), we keep a per-jurisdiction baseline of the unvalidated count — the same
# `_KNOWN_DUPLICATE_COUNTS` idiom used elsewhere in this suite. The test fails if the count
# *rises* (a regression) and is lowered intentionally when extraction improves. Run
# `uv run python scripts/generate_validation_report.py` to refresh the doc and these counts.
