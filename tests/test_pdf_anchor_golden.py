"""Golden anchor-snapshot guard + precision-harness self-test (DeltaTrack#89).

The golden snapshots pin the full ordered anchor list per fixture bill. They are
the deterministic regression guard the tolerant diff-recall suite can't provide:
they catch BOTH over-emission (spurious accounts) and under-emission (dropped
accounts) when the size-detection swap lands. Regenerate ONLY when a change is
intended, and prove the delta with the set-diff assertion in the swap commit.

Fixture policy (#287): every fixture this module pins is committed, so the gate runs
in CI instead of silently skipping (the fail-open shape #287 removes). The bills/
fixtures are in tests/corpus_manifest.toml; the tests/data/ fixtures (subcommittee
prints, the CJS Senate print) sit outside the bills/-layout manifest and are floored
directly by test_manifest_fixtures_committed. TestCorpusAccountPrecision, a tolerant net
over the larger appropriations corpus, was the last case reaching outside the committed
set; its remaining two pairs are now manifested and committed, so every case in this
module runs on a clean checkout and is fail-closed by the manifest floor (#489).

    Unlike H.R. 8752, s-4795 has variable path depth, account names that wrap

    agency. JOIN recovers the recoverable agencies but CANNOT segment a wrapped
    account name from an agency — that is the #54/#108 leveled tree, out of slice
    B's scope. So this is a floor with KNOWN, documented residue, not exact parity:

      - False positives that remain are wrapped account-name fragments and a
        provision header (e.g. 'salaries and expenses, foreign claims', 'major
        research equipment and facilities', 'administrative provision—legal
        services') — indistinguishable from agencies without the tree (#108).

    """Corpus-wide smoke floor on account vocabulary precision/recall (#89).

    Complements the exact golden snapshots (which pin three bills) with a tolerant net
    over the appropriations corpus. The floors ARE enforced minima — the assertions below
    fail under them — but they are corpus-wide smoke floors rather than tight per-bill
    regression expectations. They catch a large degradation and leave substantial unused
    margin on the easier bills: 118-hr-8752 scores 1.000/1.000 and would still pass having
    lost 40% of its accounts.

    That looseness is deliberate for now. #489 carries the full nine-bill measurement and
    the per-heading breakdown; the load-bearing conclusions are:

    - The oracle is LEVEL-CORRECT, and since #499 it reads the tree's EFFECTIVE heading
      (the `display_path` leaf) rather than the raw `header_text`. It previously asked for
      the one field that keeps a parenthetical qualifier in place of the account's name,
      so accounts the PDF side had found correctly scored as false positives. The tree
      itself was right throughout: `FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS` in 118-hr-4820 is an
      account-level node carrying its appropriation, which `TestEffectiveHeadingVocabulary`
      now pins. Correcting the oracle raised precision and recall on every corpus bill,
      which is why the floors below are higher than the numbers #489 recorded.
    - Reading the vocabulary straight from the XML instead is COMPLETE BUT LEVEL-BLIND:
      GPO tags agency names (`COAST GUARD`, `U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION`) with the
      same element types as accounts, and the PDF pipeline correctly calls those `agency`.
      Scoring them as missed accounts drops 118-hr-8752 from 1.000 recall to 0.276.
      Defining the account vocabulary needs the leveled tree, which is the #54 epic.
    - So a per-bill band table (the #489 proposal, following `test_pipeline_parity`) would
      pin numbers that do not yet mean what their names say. #499 has landed; reconsider
      once #54 does. Until then the unused margin above is the accepted cost.

    Every case runs on committed fixtures. 117-hr-4432 and 118-hr-4820 were the last
    fetched-only pairs and are now in `tests/corpus_manifest.toml`, so they are fail-closed
    by the shared manifest floor: `test_manifest_fixtures_committed` checks the whole
    manifest, not only the cases this module collects. The per-case skip below is a
    defensive fallback, not the mechanism that keeps these fixtures available.

    Why precision is well under 1.0 even when correct — the residual misses are
    KNOWN and accepted, deferred to #54, NOT bugs to chase here:
      - Provision-group headers (ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS, GENERAL PROVISIONS,
        SPENDING REDUCTION ACCOUNT) — real block headers mislabeled `account`.
      - Wrapped agency-name fragments (e.g. "FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, AIR
        FORCE" wrapping onto a line read as "FORCE") — correct labeling needs the
        leveled tree.
      - Real account names whose GPO casing/wording normalizes differently than the
        XML header (counted as a vocab miss though the anchor is right).
    The SEC.-catchline-continuation class is NOT among the accepted residue — it is
    fixed (see TestSectionCatchlineContinuation); a regression there would lower
    these numbers, but the targeted test catches it first.

    That list predates the per-heading breakdown on #489, and the third bullet is where it
    needed qualifying: on the one bill measured heading by heading (118-hr-4820), the
    dominant cause was not normalization disagreement but the oracle reading the wrong
    field, which #499 fixed. The first two bullets held up — the wrapped-fragment class is
    the 17 misses recorded on #489. The other eight bills were measured in aggregate only,
    so how the causes divide on them is unknown rather than assumed to match.
