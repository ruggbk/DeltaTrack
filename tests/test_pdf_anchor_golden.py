"""Golden anchor-snapshot guard + precision-harness self-test (DeltaTrack#89).

The golden snapshots pin the full ordered anchor list per fixture bill. They are
the deterministic regression guard the tolerant diff-recall suite can't provide:
they catch BOTH over-emission (spurious accounts) and under-emission (dropped
accounts) when the size-detection swap lands. Regenerate ONLY when a change is
intended, and prove the delta with the set-diff assertion in the swap commit.

Fixture policy (#287): every fixture this module pins is committed, so the gate runs
in CI instead of silently skipping (the fail-open shape #287 removes). The bills/
fixtures are in tests/corpus_manifest.toml; the tests/data/ fixtures (subcommittee
prints, the CJS Senate print) sit outside the bills/-layout manifest and are floored
directly by test_manifest_fixtures_committed. The ONE fetched-only case left is
TestCorpusAccountPrecision, a tolerant net over the larger appropriations corpus that
is not committed — it keeps an explicit, visible skip, like the other slow PDF suites.

    """Tolerant agency-vocab floor on the HARD bill (Senate CJS, 118-s-4795).

    Unlike H.R. 8752, s-4795 has variable path depth, account names that wrap
    across heading lines, header-only intermediate agencies, and a prose-leading
    agency. JOIN recovers the recoverable agencies but CANNOT segment a wrapped
    account name from an agency — that is the #54/#108 leveled tree, out of slice
    B's scope. So this is a floor with KNOWN, documented residue, not exact parity:

      - False positives that remain are wrapped account-name fragments and a
        provision header (e.g. 'salaries and expenses, foreign claims', 'major
        research equipment and facilities', 'administrative provision—legal
        services') — indistinguishable from agencies without the tree (#108).
      - Misses are the 3 header-only intermediate agencies (no leaf account beneath
        them) and the 1 prose-leading agency (slice D).

    The dangling-conjunction guard removes the worst mis-joins (runs joining into a
    phrase ending in 'and'/'of'/…), lifting precision from ~0.80 to ~0.865 — so the
    precision floor below is set to REQUIRE that guard (0.80 without it fails 0.82).
    Floors sit under the measured values (recall 0.889, precision 0.865) with margin
    for per-line median wobble; they are regression floors, not targets.

    Complements the exact golden snapshots (which pin three bills) with a tolerant
    net over the appropriations corpus, so a future change can't silently flood
    false accounts or drop real ones without tripping a gate. The floors sit below
    today's measured values (see scripts/heading_precision.py for the live numbers).

    Unlike the golden/subcommittee fixtures above, this corpus is FETCHED-ONLY and not
    committed (larger omnibus PDFs, out of the #287 committed set), so it keeps an
    explicit per-case skip when a pair is absent — a visible skip, like the other slow
    PDF suites (TESTING.md), not the empty-parametrization fail-open #287 removes.

    Why precision is well under 1.0 even when correct — the residual misses are
    KNOWN and accepted, deferred to #54, NOT bugs to chase here:
      - Provision-group headers (ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS, GENERAL PROVISIONS,
        SPENDING REDUCTION ACCOUNT) — real block headers mislabeled `account`.
      - Wrapped agency-name fragments (e.g. "FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, AIR
        FORCE" wrapping onto a line read as "FORCE") — correct labeling needs the
        leveled tree.
      - Real account names whose GPO casing/wording normalizes differently than the
        XML header (counted as a vocab miss though the anchor is right).
    The SEC.-catchline-continuation class is NOT among the accepted residue — it is
    fixed (see TestSectionCatchlineContinuation); a regression there would lower
    these numbers, but the targeted test catches it first.
