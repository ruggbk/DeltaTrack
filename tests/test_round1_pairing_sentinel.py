"""Round-1 correspondence, pinned per version pair by a digest of the pairing stream.

## What it is for

The canonical baselines (``tests/test_canonical_baseline.py``,
``tests/test_pdf_canonical_baseline.py``) are the primary change detector for this
repository, and they are a detector of *rendered output*. Correspondence can move without
reaching them: a matcher that pairs a different old-side observation with the same new-side
text produces byte-identical HTML. The round-1 audit measured that gap directly -- reversing
the assignment tie direction moves the pairing stream on 11 of the 27 committed version pairs
while canonical output moves on 4. Seven pairs of real correspondence change would otherwise
have no executable owner at all.

This is that owner, and it is deliberately the smallest artifact that can be one. Per
committed pair it stores the ADR 0019 provenance and a single SHA-256 over the ordered
pairing stream. Nothing else: no per-invocation populations, no candidate tuples, no
structural counts, no ``element_id`` projection.

## Why a digest of correspondence rather than a transcription of the matcher

It replaces the frozen legacy trace retired in #659, which pinned round 1 against a
transcription of the pre-ADR-0020 implementation. That artifact answered a closed question --
did the extraction preserve behaviour -- and could not survive a deliberate matching-policy
change without someone re-transcribing a new "before" implementation.

What is recorded here is *which observations correspond*, addressed by ADR 0019 ordinal. It
names no internal symbol, so renames, stage reshuffles and internal restructuring cannot
redden it; it reddens when correspondence actually moves. That is the same kind of artifact
as the canonical baselines, and it is regenerated the same way and under the same discipline:
a regeneration is a claim that the correspondence *should* have moved, and ADR 0020 asks for
independent precision/recall evidence in the pull request that makes it. It is not a step in
making a red build green.

## Identity, and why provenance is checked first

Every integer in the stream is an index into the parser's COMPLETE emitted sequence for its
side. That address is meaningful only relative to the source bytes and the parser revision it
was minted under, so both are stored beside it and both are checked before any digest is
compared. If either has moved, the stored judgment describes a sequence that no longer exists
and comparing digests would silently rebind it to a different parse -- the failure ADR 0019
was written for. So the provenance gate refuses rather than regenerates.
