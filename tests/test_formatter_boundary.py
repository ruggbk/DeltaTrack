"""The renderer decides legibility; the differ decides correspondence. Separately.

ADR 0020 names one coupling in the rendering layer and requires its removal: the HTML
renderer recomputed the differ's word-overlap score and compared it against the differ's
own cutoff, so changing what "the same provision" means also changed what a reader saw,
in the same edit, with no way to test the two apart. `formatters/_text.word_diff` now
reads `LEGIBILITY_THRESHOLD`, which the rendering layer owns.

**The two numbers are equal today and nothing here asserts that.** A test pinning
`LEGIBILITY_THRESHOLD == SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` would rebuild the coupling inside the
suite and would redden the moment the differ is legitimately retuned (#368, #170 are both
open and both would move it). The legibility cutoff is pinned to a *literal* instead.

## Why three gates and not one

Each of the first three is defeated by a mistake the others catch, which is the whole
reason the set has three members rather than one:

`test_the_legibility_cutoff_is_pinned_to_its_own_literal`
    catches a retuned render. Defeated on its own by a **dead constant**: declare
    `LEGIBILITY_THRESHOLD = 0.4`, then write `threshold: float = 0.4` in the signature.
    The constant is then decorative and this test still passes.

`test_no_formatter_depends_on_the_correspondence_cutoff`
    catches re-coupling. Defeated on its own by the same dead constant, and by a bare
    literal: an import-graph gate cannot tell a wired constant from an unwired one.

`test_word_diff_takes_its_default_from_the_legibility_cutoff`
    closes exactly that hole by reading the *default expression* rather than its value.
    Defeated on its own by pointing `LEGIBILITY_THRESHOLD` at the wrong number, which the
    literal pin catches.

The fourth gate is behavioural and is the only one that shows the cutoff has any effect at
all: two synthetic cases either side of it, driven through the real `_prose_body_html`
caller rather than through `word_diff`. Calling `word_diff` with an explicit threshold
exercises the parameter, and the parameter is not what this slice changed.

## Why the controls are source mutations, not monkeypatches

`word_diff`'s threshold is a default argument, bound once at import. Rebinding
`_text.LEGIBILITY_THRESHOLD` (or `similarity.SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`) at runtime therefore
cannot reach it, and a runtime-perturbation test asserting "the render did not move"
passes whether or not the separation exists -- it passed on the coupled code this slice
replaced. That is a fact about the language, not about the design, so production keeps its
ordinary bound default and the negative controls edit the source and re-run instead. The
controls are recorded in the pull request rather than shipped, because each one is a
deliberate defect.

## What is deliberately NOT asserted

That the committed examples are insensitive to this cutoff. They are today: every change
in the corpus that reaches `_prose_body_html` scores at or above 0.4, because the differ's
own cutoff upstream guarantees it, so the rendered examples stay byte-identical even with
the legibility cutoff destroyed. That blind spot was measured and is recorded in the pull
request as a reason the example gate is regression evidence rather than architecture
proof. It is not pinned here: a future matching or corpus change may legitimately make the
examples exercise the cutoff, and that would be an improvement, not a regression.
