"""The PDF matching decisions that no gate could previously detect a change to.

Slice 0 of the ADR 0020 PDF convergence work
(``docs/research/pdf-matching-convergence/``). Four production mutations —
``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`` to 0.45 and 0.35, ``MOVE_THRESHOLD`` to 0.65 and 0.55, each
changing real corpus output — were run against the full suite and **all four stayed
green**, 3227 tests apiece. The canonical baseline (``tests/test_pdf_canonical_baseline``)
now catches any of them that moves a committed pair. This module catches the *rules*, at
the sites that decide them, including on inputs the corpus does not contain.

**Every gate here carries its own falsification.** ADR 0020 invariant 12 is called out in
the record as "a green-by-default gate of the kind that has passed while checking nothing
before (#299, #542)", so a control that has never produced a positive result is not
trusted. Each rule below is paired with a test that applies a NAMED mutation and asserts
the result changes. Those mutation tests are permanent, not one-off probes: if a future
refactor makes a mutation stop mattering, the mutation test fails and says so.

The three gates, and the mutation each is falsified by:

``test_split_population*``  a real below-cutoff split carrying money on both sides.
                            Falsified by the boundary pair either side of the cutoff.
``test_positional_replace`` the positional ``replace`` zip.
                            Falsified by global best-similarity assignment.
``test_greedy_*``           round-2 competition and exclusivity.
                            Falsified by four separate mutations, one at a time.

**Retired in #659: the two transcribed rules and their corpus sweeps.** The transcribed move
rule and the corpus-wide comparisons of both rules against every committed hunk are gone, together
with ``test_the_transcribed_rules_can_fail``. They pinned the rules as they stood so that later
slices had something to be behaviour-preserving against; that question is closed, and a
transcription cannot survive a deliberate change to either cutoff without being rewritten to
match it.

What that costs, recorded here rather than left to be rediscovered: ``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD``
keeps an off-corpus owner in ``test_split_boundary_falsifies_the_cutoff``, which straddles the
cutoff directly. ``MOVE_THRESHOLD`` does not — after this, a change to it is caught by
``tests/test_pdf_canonical_baseline.py`` when it moves a committed pair, and by nothing when it
does not.

No production code is changed by this module. It pins current behaviour so that the stage
extraction in later slices has something to be behaviour-preserving *against*.

#: EVERY adjacent committed PDF pair, including the six ``compare.pdf`` refuses.

#: That is deliberate here, and it is a different choice from
#: ``tests/test_pdf_canonical_baseline``, which pins the product-facing behaviour and so
#: must know which pairs are accepted. The rules transcribed below are invariants of
#: ``diff_pdfs`` itself; admissibility is decided a layer above, in ``compare.pdf``, and a
#: refused pair still exercises the split and move rules. So the division is: gate 1 covers
#: what a user can reach, this module covers what the differ must always do.
#:
#: An earlier version of this list tried to exclude the refused pairs with a proxy —
#: ``len(cached_pages(...)) > 1`` — and got it wrong in both directions: it let all six
#: declined pairs through (an enrolled print has many pages; what it lacks is line numbers)
#: while dropping one legitimate pair whose old side is a one-page shell. The proxy is gone
#: rather than repaired, because the real predicate is ``compare.pdf._is_unnumbered_layout``
#: and reaching into it would add another private cross-module import to the tangle #62
#: tracks. See the convergence record's "source conflicts" note.
