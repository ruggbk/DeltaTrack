"""Recall test for diff_pdf against the 13-case spec in tests/data/pdf/118hr8752-changes.md.

Each fixture case asserts:
  1. A hunk exists whose page+line range covers the case's location(s).
  2. The hunk's change_type matches the fixture's declared type.
  3. For numeric cases (cases 1-8: floor amendment annotations), the hunk
     has has_amendment_annotations=True.
  4. The case's changed prose surfaces as a contiguous run in some hunk — the
     word-level counterpart to the amount-recall tests ("would we see sneaked-in
     language?").

The fixture is the spec; failures here are the things the diff doesn't
yet surface correctly. See the Phase 5 section of
plans/test-coverage-expansion.md for the prose-recall rationale and findings.
