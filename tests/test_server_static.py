"""Tests for the static front-end served by server/app.py.

These guard the "View a sample report" path that broke in #41: the landing
page must link directly to a reachable sample document, and the static mount
must serve it. Skipped if fastapi isn't installed.

Scope / known gap: these assert routing and asset reachability, NOT browser
runtime behavior. The #41 root cause was a popup opened on page load (outside a
user gesture) being blocked by the browser — only a real browser (e.g.
Playwright) reproduces that. A Node/browser toolchain isn't worth it for one
static page today; if the web UI grows interactive JS, revisit a browser test.
