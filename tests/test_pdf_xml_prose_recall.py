"""Structure-free cross-check for PROSE: sentences the bill XML carries must be
recoverable from the PDF of the same version.

The amount cross-check (test_pdf_xml_amount_recall.py) uses the XML as an oracle for
the PDF text pipeline, but only for dollar amounts. Text extraction had no external
grounding at all on published bills -- only synthetic sentinels
(test_pdf_injection_recall.py) and one hand-built draft fixture (#7). Yet the product
reports changes in prose as well as in money, so the prose half of the pipeline was
resting on internal consistency alone.

GPO's XML is an independent transcription of the same document, which makes it the
same kind of oracle for prose that it already is for amounts, at no hand-transcription
cost. The question asked here is RECALL -- did the sentence survive extraction? -- not
fidelity: comparison is substring matching after `normalize_for_cross_format`, which
erases the accent, quote, hyphen, and punctuation-spacing conventions the two formats
disagree about. A miss means a run of words present in the official text is absent from
what the tool read, which is either:

  - a PDF extraction failure (a line dropped by page-chrome stripping, a column
    misordered, a wrap that lost a word), or
  - an XML-side artifact -- text GPO's XML renders in a form the PDF never had.

Both are worth seeing. Unlike amounts, prose does not reach 100%, so the gate is a
FLOOR on recall per print layout, backed by a corpus-level floor on how much prose is
being compared at all (`test_corpus_yields_prose_to_compare`). The second matters as
much as the first: a fragment extractor that silently yielded nothing would otherwise
pass every per-version assertion here at 100%.

Nothing in this module is keyed to an individual bill. The corpus is curated and still
growing, so a per-bill baseline would turn every fixture addition into a recalibration
chore and, worse, invite clearing the red by pasting in whatever the run produced. The
floors key on the print LAYOUT because that is what the defects are properties of, and
the found-nothing guard is a corpus aggregate rather than per-bill counts. A new bill is
therefore either covered the moment it lands, or held to the full floor.

Floors are calibrated on the whole fixture corpus (scripts/calibrate_prose_recall.py)
and set below the measured worst case of their layout with deliberate headroom. They
lock the claim "essentially all prose survives extraction, except where a named defect
says otherwise", which should stay true. Investigate a drop; do not re-baseline the
floor to whatever the run produced.

What the residue currently is, as of the calibration run that set these floors. Seven
of the nine print layouts in the corpus recall 99.5-100%, and the two that do not are
held there by extraction defects this cross-check found, not by a comparison that is
too strict. The defects belong to the LAYOUT, which is why the floors key on it:

  - Enrolled prints (worst 94.0%) carry no margin line numbers, so `extract_clean_pages`
    treats a line-initial integer as one and drops it: "not more than 25 percent" reads
    as "not more than percent". The same layout's running header is not recognised as
    page furniture, so "H. R. 4366-4" splices into the middle of a sentence.
  - Senate engrossed amendments (worst 88.0%) DO carry line numbers, and show the chrome
    half of that defect on its own: the running footer splices in mid-word, so "inland
    waterways projects" extracts as "inland water(dagger) HR 5895 EAS ways projects".
    Same shape as the running footer fixed in #140 for the "PCS" variant.

Within the healthy layouts, two residues are worth naming because they are real and
deliberately not normalized away:

  - On a line carrying a vulgar fraction, the extractor emits the margin line number
    mid-line rather than at the start, where line-number stripping would catch it, so a
    stray integer welds itself into a number: "18 3/4 percent" reads as "183 15 /4
    percent". That is the whole of 119-hr-1's 99.5%.
  - A space is lost where a line wraps between two parentheticals: "$5,000,000)
    (reduced by" extracts as "$5,000,000)(reduced by". A missing space is text the tool
    got wrong, and folding it away here would canonicalize a defect rather than a
    convention.

None of these is visible to the amount cross-check: the corrupted figures are
percentages and page numbers rather than dollar amounts.

What this CANNOT see, established by injecting each fault and watching the result:
making `normalize_glyphs` a no-op leaves every case green, because the comparison runs
the same normalization over both sides, so a change there cancels out. Glyph handling is
gated by the golden prints (test_pdf_extraction_golden.py), not here. Dropping extracted
lines, extracting no fragments at all, and a layout floor that is no longer earned all
do fail.
