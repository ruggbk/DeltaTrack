"""Canonical `tree` field — the structure tree exposed in the contract (#108, step 4A).

Asserts on the CONSUMED output (the canonical JSON + its schema), not an internal
tree dump (feedback_measure_at_consumed_output): the tree validates against the
published schema, its spans slice the right text, money is conserved, and an
account named "Title 17 …" carries level=account (the #155-immune data).
