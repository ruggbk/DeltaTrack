"""The PDF ADR 0019 identity machinery: parser revision, and the observation registry.

Slice 3 of the ADR 0020 PDF convergence work. Two things are under test, and they fail in
opposite directions, so each needs its own controls.

**The parser revision** answers "which parse was this stored judgment about?". Its whole job
is to move when observation-producing code moves and to stay put otherwise, so a test that
only checked "it returns a hash" would certify a constant. The exclusion half is the
load-bearing one: slice 1 existed specifically so that editing a matching threshold could no
longer redefine observation identity, and an exclusion is an absence claim, which is the shape
that passes vacuously. It is therefore proved twice — once by mutating the matcher and seeing
nothing move, and once by *injecting an import of the matcher into the parser* and seeing the
revision move. The second is what separates "the exclusion holds" from "the walker is broken".

**The registry** answers "which observation is ordinal N?". ADR 0019 names indexing a filtered
or re-sorted view as a genuine new hazard, because such an address looks valid and points at
the wrong observation. Gate 5
(``test_pdf_observation_emission.test_an_ordinal_over_a_filtered_view_addresses_a_different_observation``)
already pins that hazard against the emitted sequence and is not duplicated here. What is new
in slice 3 is the *address resolution layer* on top of it: totality, injectivity, round-trip,
and failing closed on an address the parse never issued.

No production behaviour is exercised: nothing consumes ``PdfObservation`` yet. These are tests
of the representation itself, which is the only thing slice 3 adds.
