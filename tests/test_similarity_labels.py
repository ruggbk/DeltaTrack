"""Answer key for the section-matching similarity thresholds (DeltaTrack #8).

`tests/data/similarity_labels.json` is a hand-labeled set of real section pairs, each
tagged SAME (a revision of one provision -> the matcher should link them) or DIFFERENT
(unrelated provisions that merely share boilerplate -> should not be linked). We run the
production similarity pipeline (`_text_similarity(_normalize_text(...))`) over the frozen
text and check whether the governing threshold classifies each pair the way a human did.

Three kinds of pairs:

  * Clear-cut anchors (extreme similarity, self-evident label). These MUST classify
    correctly; a failure is a real regression in the thresholds or the similarity code.
  * Five human-ruled dead-zone pairs (0.40-0.63 band). The current thresholds get all
    five wrong, so they are `xfail(strict=False)`: they pin the failure mode as an
    executable spec and flip to XPASS if the thresholds are ever improved (#170). Their
    `expected_misclassified` flag in the fixture is the frozen finding.
  * One extreme clear-cut miss (119-hr-1 Alien SNAP, a stub expanded to full text,
    sim 0.078). High-confidence SAME, not a judgment call, yet far below the 0.40 floor,
    so it too is `xfail`. It is the #8-body anchor for the stub->expanded failure mode.

Body-text-only ON PURPOSE. The dead-zone misses are the evidence for #170: pure text
similarity has no skill there, and the disambiguating signal is structural context (the
division > agency > account breadcrumb), not more text. Pairs 4 and 5 are the worked
examples in that issue. Self-contained: no `bills/` dependency; regenerate the fixture
with `scripts/build_similarity_labels.py` if the corpus text or thresholds change.
