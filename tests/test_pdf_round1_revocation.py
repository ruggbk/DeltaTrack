"""Slice 5: the round-1 similarity revocation, as evidence plus a rule that owns its threshold.

``_emit_pair`` used to do three things in one place — measure the two block texts, decide
whether the aligned pair survived, and emit the records. Slice 5 separates them into
``pdf_similarity_correspondence_evidence`` (describes), ``pdf_pairing_survives_similarity_rule``
(decides, owns the threshold) and ``apply_pdf_similarity_revocation`` (applies).

**What gate 4 already covers, and is not repeated here.** ``test_pdf_matching_boundary`` pins
the split *rule* against an independently transcribed oracle, over the corpus and at two
synthetic points either side of the cutoff. That establishes what the rule is. It cannot
establish that the extracted stages are what apply it, because it runs ``diff_pdfs`` end to end
with the production constant — one number reaching one behaviour, with no way to tell which
code read it.

So the control this module adds is the one gate 4 structurally cannot: **move the threshold at
the stage boundary and watch the split population respond**. A revocation rule that had been
left behind in ``_align_blocks``, or a stage reading ``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`` directly instead
of its parameter, passes every existing gate and fails here.
