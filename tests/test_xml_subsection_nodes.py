"""XML subsection-node completeness + cross-pipeline convergence gate (DeltaTrack#188).

The XML side of the #96 parity story. ``bill_tree`` now emits every direct,
non-quoted ``<subsection>`` as its own node; this module gates that against the
same regex-independent raw-XML oracle ``test_pdf_subsection_recall`` built
(``_xml_index``: header-OR-inline catchline denominator, quoted-block exclusion),
and asserts the convergence #96 could not yet assert:

- **Completeness** (``test_xml_emits_every_oracle_subsection``): the emitted
  ``(section, enum)`` set equals the oracle's ``all_pairs`` — every real,
  non-quoted subsection is a node, and nothing else is. Exact on every fixture,
  119-hr-1 included: it used to carry a documented residue because
  ``normalize_bill`` did not walk ``<subpart>`` containers, so its subpart SEC.s
  were never nodes; #190 added ``subpart`` to ``_STRUCTURAL_TAGS`` and closed that
  gap (missing 44 -> 0), so the gate is now exact everywhere.
- **Quoted-block zero leak** (``test_no_quoted_block_leak``): checked by element
  identity (``element_id`` vs the quoted elements' ``id`` attrs), not by
  ``(section, enum)`` pairs — a bill can legitimately carry the same pair both
  quoted and unquoted, so pair-set subtraction would under-report a leak.
- **Convergence** (``test_pdf_and_xml_converge_on_catchline_subsections``): on the
  clean documents, the PDF-detected set, the XML catchline-labeled subset, and the
  oracle catchline denominator are all EQUAL — the same (section, enum) landmarks
  from either source. "Clean" is now derived from the PDF module's recorded residue
  rather than named (#488): 11 of the 13 committed pairs qualify, and the two that
  do not are the enrolled print (the anchor pipeline declines it, #141) and 119-hr-1,
  which carries the documented #96 PDF residue (2 doubled-enum FPs) and where XML
  deliberately exceeds PDF anyway (bare + roman-enum subsections — the
  all-subsections scope decision recorded on #188).

All three read every committed PDF/XML pair. They read three until #488, because the
document list is shared with ``test_pdf_subsection_recall`` and the gap there was
inherited here.

Fail-open guards (#167 / feedback_property_tests_fail_open): both denominators are
pinned EXACTLY per document in that module's ``EXPECTED``, so neither an empty oracle
nor an empty emission can pass vacuously, and neither can a partial one — which the
``>=`` floors these replaced would have absorbed.
