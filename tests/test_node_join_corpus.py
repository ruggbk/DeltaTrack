"""Corpus behavioral gates for the own-span containment join (#172).

Behavioral, not geometric: these assert "change X files under node Y" as
observable in the view/rendered output on stable corpus pairs — deliberately
NOT a corpus-wide span-geometry property test (the extent investigation on
#172 concluded that would only pin incidental overlap counts) and NOT
full-page snapshots (#170 will later change which pairs the cards show).

XML ground truth: the change's structural ``path`` (display_path) and the tree
derive from the same serializer, so the joined breadcrumb must match the
structural path exactly — except the leading short-title/definitions sections,
which the tree groups under the synthesized Front Matter node (#161) where the
flat path says just "Sec. 1"; there the join is deeper, and pinning it proves
deepest-wins live (a naive bisect files these under "Front Matter" itself).

PDF ground truth: the anchor breadcrumb (``path``), resolved structurally from
the same anchor stream that builds the tree.

Every fixture these gates pin is committed to git and named in
``tests/corpus_manifest.toml`` (#220), so they collect the same cases on every
machine and in CI. ``test_manifest_fixtures_committed`` fails closed if one is
absent, replacing the old REQUIRE_CORPUS env-var opt-in under which these gates
collected zero cases and passed green on an unfetched checkout (#167).
