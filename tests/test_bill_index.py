"""Tests for bill_index CSV encode/decode round-trip (issue #61).

The write and read paths are asymmetric and worth testing together rather than
separately: writing goes through the hand-rolled ``_format_csv_cell``, while reading
goes through ``csv.DictReader`` (which already removes CSV quoting) and *then*
``_decode_value``. A cell therefore passes two unquoting stages, and only the
round-trip shows what the second one does to text the first one quoted.

Cases here are constructed from the declared domain rather than sampled from the
corpus. The index stores free text from bill XML (``title``, ``status``,
``policyArea``) alongside genuinely numeric counts, and the current corpus happens to
contain no title that would exercise the quote-decoding edges -- so corpus-derived
cases would bound only the observed input space, not the space the code accepts.

#256 is fixed in both halves, and the round trip is now lossless for every case here.
``_decode_value`` no longer unquotes a second time (``TestQuoteWrappedTextRoundTrips``)
and no longer coerces digits to ``int`` (``TestNumericLookingTextSurvives``). Both
fixes removed a guess: what a cell means is no longer inferred from its shape, so a
value comes back as the text that was stored.

That makes the counting columns (``actionCount`` and peers) read back as text too,
which ``TestNumericColumns`` pins deliberately rather than by omission.
