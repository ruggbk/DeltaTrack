"""Browser-level (Playwright) tests for the Pass 2 labeling form (#333).

The form (`docs/research/provision-matching/probes/form_template.html`) is where a reviewer's
afternoon of hand labels turns into a file. All of its logic is embedded JavaScript, and the
load-bearing part is the completeness rule: a card reaches the download only with an answer, a
confidence, and — at medium or low confidence — a written rationale. Cards failing that are
dropped silently, which is indistinguishable from cards the reviewer never reached. Nothing
exercised any of it.

These drive a real browser against a real generated form and assert on the downloaded JSON,
because the rule only exists at runtime. Also covers the decision-time timestamps (#334) and the
not-yet-downloaded counter (#335), both of which live in the same export path.

Marked ``browser``; excluded from the default suite. Run with::

    uv run playwright install chromium   # one-time, downloads the browser
    uv run pytest -m browser
