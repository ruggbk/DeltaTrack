"""Corpus + golden validation for the PDF division level (DeltaTrack#107).

Pins three things across every division-bearing version present (fetch with
`./tools/fetch_bills.py download <congress> <type> <number> --format both`; absent bills
skip, matching the other corpus suites):
  1. Division COUNT == the XML division count on every parseable version (hard) —
     the 33-division FY22 omnibus included.
  2. Division NAMES match XML (modulo casing) on every parseable version, with two
     catalogued residues in `_KNOWN_NAME_RESIDUE` (a genuine compound that wraps at
     its hyphen; an XML-side hyphen artifact) — neither a detector bug.
  3. The end-to-end breadcrumb: a real anchor's `breadcrumb_for` leads with its
     division, proving anchor identity survives the rebuild in `extract_anchors`
     (fresh-eyes #6).

Enrolled bills are typeset without margin line numbers, so they yield no TITLE anchors
(DeltaTrack#141). They are ASSERTED rather than skipped: the version must be a declared
zero-anchor layout in `_PDF_NO_TITLE_ANCHOR_LAYOUTS` and must still classify as unnumbered,
so a numbered print that silently stops producing anchors reddens instead of going green.
