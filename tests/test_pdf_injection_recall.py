"""Synthetic-injection recall: does sneaked-in language get detected AND shown?

The threat model is someone slipping new text into a bill at the last minute (a
rider, earmark, or clause). This test turns the structural guarantee of the diff
engine into an executable check: we start from a real v1 (HR 8752 reported), inject
uniquely-tokenized phrases at distinct locations to build a synthetic v2, run
`diff_pdfs`, and assert each sentinel surfaces in two places:

  1. Detection: some hunk carries the sentinel in its changed-side text.
  2. Display: the sentinel appears in the rendered HTML.

The sentinels are nonsense tokens (`ZZQ...`) so they can't collide with real bill
text and survive HTML escaping unchanged. All scenarios are expected to pass; a
failure is a real detection-or-display gap, to be documented in
plans/pdf-text-diff-findings.md rather than worked around.
