"""Direct unit tests for the committee-report pairing rules (issue #295).

These exercise ``get_report_pairing()`` itself, rather than the manifest it wrote.
Both are worth having and they fail for different reasons: a manifest assertion says
the recorded answer is right *today*, while these say the rule that produces it is
right, including for stage/chamber combinations no committed bill happens to have.
A manifest-only gate also cannot distinguish "the rule is correct" from "the rule is
broken and the stored data is stale", because it reads the stored data.

Fast (unmarked) on purpose: pure functions over literals, no fixtures and no network,
so they run in the fast CI step where a broken rule surfaces in seconds.
