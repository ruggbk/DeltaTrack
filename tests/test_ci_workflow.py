"""Guardrails on the triggers of the workflows that own a required status check.

Two properties are pinned here: that the test suite runs when a commit lands on the
integration branch (#412), and that both required checks answer the merge_group event so
a merge queue can complete a merge (#416).


Nothing ran the test suite when a commit landed on ``develop``, so a broken integration
branch went unreported: ``ci.yml`` fired on ``pull_request`` and on pushes to ``main``
only, while ``security.yml`` did cover ``develop`` on push. The branch therefore showed
green marks after a merge that had left the suite uncollectable, because the workflows
producing those marks never run the tests.

The fix is two words in a YAML list, which is exactly why it is worth pinning: it can be
undone by a reformat, a merge resolution, or a well-meant "align the triggers" edit, and
nothing else in the repository would notice. The comment block in ``ci.yml`` argues both
decisions at length; prose that no test enforces reads as settled while being ungated.

These are deliberately narrow. They assert the two properties #412 turns on and say
nothing about the rest of the workflow, so adding a job or a step does not touch them.
