"""Guardrails on the triggers of the workflows that own a required status check.

Three properties are pinned here: that the test suite runs when a commit lands on the
integration branch (#412), that both required checks answer the merge_group event so
a merge queue can complete a merge (#416), and that every module carrying a @slow test
is named by some workflow, since the marker alone makes a gate runnable but never run.


Nothing ran the test suite when a commit landed on ``develop``, so a broken integration
branch went unreported: ``ci.yml`` fired on ``pull_request`` and on pushes to ``main``
only, while ``security.yml`` did cover ``develop`` on push. The branch therefore showed
green marks after a merge that had left the suite uncollectable, because the workflows
producing those marks never run the tests.

The fix is two words in a YAML list, which is exactly why it is worth pinning: it can be
undone by a reformat, a merge resolution, or a well-meant "align the triggers" edit, and
nothing else in the repository would notice. The comment block in ``ci.yml`` argues both
decisions at length; prose that no test enforces reads as settled while being ungated.

These are deliberately narrow. They assert the two properties #412 turns on and say
nothing about the rest of the workflow, so adding a job or a step does not touch them.

# explains at the reporting step. The report was gated on
#
#     if: failure() && steps.parity.outcome == 'failure'
#
# so it also required the CHECK to have failed. A checkout, uv, Python-install or
# `uv sync` failure leaves that step `skipped` -- or unset, when checkout dies before the
# step exists -- so the workflow went red and filed nothing (#680).
#
# That is fail-open in the worse direction. A parity failure is a real signal about
# upstream data that someone would eventually chase; a broken runner is invisible, and
# the gate stops running entirely while every Monday adds another red to an inbox nobody
# owns. Four scheduled runs had passed at the time of filing, so the reporting step had

    red is giving both branches the same title, or dropping the branch entirely.

    The three cases are the three values CI can actually produce. `failure` is the check
    itself; `skipped` is a step that failed ahead of it; the empty string is the checkout
    dying before the parity step exists, so `steps.parity` never enters the context. The
    last is the headline case of #680 and is the reason the assertions run from an empty
    directory.
