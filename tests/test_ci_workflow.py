"""Guardrails on the triggers of the workflows that own a required status check.

Three properties are pinned here: that the test suite runs when a commit lands on the
integration branch (#412), that both required checks answer the merge_group event so
a merge queue can complete a merge (#416), and that every module carrying a @slow test
is named by some workflow, since the marker alone makes a gate runnable but never run.


Nothing ran the test suite when a commit landed on ``develop``, so a broken integration
branch went unreported: ``ci.yml`` fired on ``pull_request`` and on pushes to ``main``
only, while ``security.yml`` did cover ``develop`` on push. The branch therefore showed
green marks after a merge that had left the suite uncollectable, because the workflows
producing those marks never run the tests.

The fix is two words in a YAML list, which is exactly why it is worth pinning: it can be
undone by a reformat, a merge resolution, or a well-meant "align the triggers" edit, and
nothing else in the repository would notice. The comment block in ``ci.yml`` argues both
decisions at length; prose that no test enforces reads as settled while being ungated.

These are deliberately narrow. They assert the two properties #412 turns on and say
nothing about the rest of the workflow, so adding a job or a step does not touch them.

# has never run looks identical to a gate that runs and passes.

# runnable, naming its module is what makes it RUN"), which is precisely the situation

# gate (#507 review).

    The block runs pytest and mentions two modules, but only one is an argument to that

    whole cannot tell them apart, so the disabled module inherits its neighbour's
    invocation. Splitting into logical commands is what separates them.

    The echo is deliberately UNQUOTED. Quoting the path puts a `"` immediately before it,
