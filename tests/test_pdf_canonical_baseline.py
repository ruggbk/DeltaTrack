"""Canonical PDF diff output is pinned byte for byte over the committed PDF corpus.

The PDF half of ADR 0020's acceptance criterion, and the gate the XML baseline said was
owed: *"a PDF baseline is owed before any PDF-side stage extraction happens"*
(``tests/test_canonical_baseline.py``). Until this existed, that debt was not a
theoretical one. Four production mutations — ``SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`` to 0.45 and 0.35,
``MOVE_THRESHOLD`` to 0.65 and 0.55, each changing real corpus output — were run against
the full suite and **all four stayed green**, 3227 tests apiece. Not one test detected any
of them. All four now redden this module, which is what it exists for.

The probe that measured the original blindness
(``docs/research/pdf-matching-convergence/probes/mutate_production_and_run_suite.py``) was
removed from HEAD at research closure and remains in Git history. Its question is settled and
owned here: to re-measure, mutate a cutoff in ``diff_pdf`` and run this module. Mutate inside
``diff_pdf`` rather than ``similarity`` — the latter reddens the XML baseline and says nothing
about PDF — and never by monkeypatching, since both cutoffs bind at import.

The claim this supports is exactly as wide as the XML baseline's:

    A matching-policy change that affects one of the committed PDF pairs will move this
    baseline.

Not "any matching-policy change moves a byte". A change reachable only by an input the
corpus does not contain stays green here. That is the general limit of a corpus gate, and
it is why ADR 0020 also requires independent precision and recall evidence for a policy
change rather than letting this stand in for it.

**What it runs.** Every adjacent version pair of committed PDFs, through
``compare.pdf.compare_pdfs`` — the public canonical producer the web app calls, not a
chain reassembled here. Measuring at the consumed output is the point: a gate that
re-implemented the extract → diff → serialize composition could stay green while
production's composition changed.

**It pins the decline as well as the diff, which the XML baseline has no analogue for.**
``compare_pdfs`` refuses an unnumbered (enrolled) layout by raising
``UnsupportedLayoutError``, and 6 of the 23 committed adjacent pairs are refused. Those
pairs are recorded as ``{"declined": true}`` rather than dropped from the set. Two reasons,
and the second is the load-bearing one. Dropping them would make the pinned population
depend on a production decision that nothing checks, so a regression in
``_MIN_NUMBERED_RATIO`` or ``_MIN_LINES_FOR_GUARD`` would silently move which pairs are
covered while every remaining digest still matched. And the admissibility decision is
itself product behaviour a staffer sees — a bill that starts being refused, or starts being
diffed when it should be refused, is a change worth a red test.

Deriving the population by *attempting* the comparison, rather than by calling
``_is_unnumbered_layout`` directly, is deliberate for the same reason: it uses only the
public surface, so the gate cannot drift from the predicate it describes, and it does not
add another private reach-around to the tangle #62 tracks.

**Why a digest and not the JSON.** The pairs serialize to tens of megabytes. A SHA-256 over
the sorted-key serialization answers the only question asked — did any byte move — and
cannot be satisfied by coincidence. The counts beside it assert nothing the digest does
not; they exist so a failure reads ``moved 64 -> 61`` instead of "two hex strings differ",
which is the difference between a diagnosis and a bisect.

**The self-reference, stated rather than assumed.** The expected values are produced by the
code under test, so regenerating them makes any change look intended. Three things keep
that from being free. Regeneration is opt-in (``UPDATE_PDF_BASELINE=1``), so it cannot
happen as a side effect of a normal run. The rewritten file lands in the diff, where a
reviewer sees which pairs moved. And ADR 0020 requires independent precision and recall
evidence in the pull request that changes matching policy, so a baseline update with no
such evidence is the review signal, not a formality.

To regenerate after an INTENTIONAL canonical-output change, then review the JSON diff:

    UPDATE_PDF_BASELINE=1 uv run pytest tests/test_pdf_canonical_baseline.py

Regeneration is all-or-nothing: a missing fixture refuses the write rather than committing
a baseline that silently covers fewer pairs (the shape #296 closed for the PDF extraction
golden, and #542 for a gate that passed while checking nothing).
