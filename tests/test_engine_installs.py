"""The engine installs into a clean environment and runs there (#398).

This is the gate the rest of the suite cannot be. Every other test imports `deltatrack`
from an editable install pointed straight at `src/`, which reports on the working tree,
not on the distribution -- a module left out of the wheel, a packaging config that drifts
from the layout, or a dependency declared in the wrong place all pass that way and break
on the first person who actually installs the thing.

So build the wheel, install it into a throwaway environment with no dev groups, and run a
real diff from a directory that is not the checkout. Three separate claims, each of which
has its own way of going quietly wrong:

* **It imports at all**, and imports from the *installed* copy. Asserted on
  `deltatrack.__file__`, not inferred from the import succeeding: with the checkout on
  `sys.path` the import would succeed either way, which is the fallback that makes an
  install check pass for the wrong reason. Running from a temp cwd already prevents it;
  the assertion is what proves the prevention worked.
* **The whole package shipped, not just the top level.** The diff exercises `parsers`,
  `diff_bill`, `formatters` and `compare` in one call, so a subpackage missing from the
  wheel fails here rather than on a user's machine.
* **`[project.dependencies]` is honest in both directions.** `pypdfium2` must arrive with
  the engine, and nothing from the `web`, `fetch`, or `dev` dependency-groups must -- the
  claim ADR 0016 makes and #367 shipped with no way to check. #593 broadened this from a
  hardcoded three-name tuple (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`) that only ever covered the
  `web` group: #533 found a `dev`-group package (`tomlkit`) declared in
  `[project.dependencies]` too, and the old probe had no way to catch it.

Marked `slow`: it builds a wheel and creates a virtualenv, so it belongs to the gate CI
runs for engine changes rather than to the fast inner loop.
