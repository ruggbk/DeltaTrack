"""Corpus-wide smoke tests for the PDF block-level diff.

The PDF analog of the XML corpus smoke in test_diff_validation.py. These check
invariants that should hold for ANY PDF diff, using only the flat structure the
PDF pipeline actually has (page/line ranges, change types) — no XML alignment,
since structural parity between the two pipelines is intentionally not a goal
(see plans/test-coverage-expansion.md). Failures here indicate the diff produced
something incoherent, not that a particular comparison is wrong.

Runs against every adjacent PDF version pair in the corpus. Marked @slow.
