"""Shared discovery + caching for corpus-wide PDF tests.

Both the amount-recall cross-check (test_pdf_xml_amount_recall.py) and the diff
smoke suite (test_pdf_corpus_smoke.py) iterate over the bill PDFs. `cached_pages`
extracts each PDF at most once per session (in-memory) and persists the result
to disk so later `pytest` runs skip extraction entirely — extracting a large
omnibus still costs real time, so the disk cache is the main developer-loop speedup.

Set TEST_BILL to a bill name (or substring, e.g. "4366") to restrict both
suites to that bill for a fast TDD loop.

    to ``tests/corpus/`` alone would have silently dropped that exploratory breadth, and
    nothing asserts a sweep's case count, so the loss would not turn anything red.

    The sweep widens by BILL, not by version: ``sweep_bill_dirs`` yields one directory per
    bill id with the committed copy winning, so a download-only *version* of a bill that
    is committed for some other stage stays invisible even under ``CORPUS_SWEEP=1``. That
    is deliberate (a downloaded copy must not shadow committed bytes) but it does mean the
    sweep is not a strict superset of what the pre-#308 glob reached. See #308.

    No ``.is_dir()`` guard on the fixture tree: it is committed, so its absence is a broken
    checkout and should raise here rather than quietly collect zero cases — the fail-open
    shape AGENTS.md warns against for parametrization lists.
