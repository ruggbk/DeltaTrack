"""Tests for section renumbering reconciliation.

**Re-aimed for ADR 0020 slice 2, meanings unchanged.** These pinned the move pass when it was
``reconcile_moves``, a single function taking classified ``NodeDiff`` records. That pass is now
the round-2 retrieval, evidence and assignment stages, running *before* classification over
unmatched observations, so the tests drive it through :func:`reconciled` below.

What each test asserts is unchanged: which texts pair and which do not, what the resulting record
looks like, and what the greedy claim leaves behind. Those are input-to-output facts derived from
the texts, not transcriptions of the implementation, so the oracle survives the harness change --
and their meanings staying identical is itself evidence the policy did not move.
