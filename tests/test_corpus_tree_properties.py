"""Corpus-wide property gate for the leveled structure tree (#108, step 5).

The per-fixture gates in ``test_structure_tree.py`` and ``test_canonical_tree.py``
prove the tree's invariants on a handful of hand-picked bills. This module
parametrizes the SAME invariants over every parseable bill version in the corpus,
so a parser change that breaks one of them on an un-pinned bill trips here instead
of in production. It asserts on the **contract-shaped tree** (the canonical JSON
nodes both pipelines emit), not an internal ``TreeNode`` dump — the consumed output
(``feedback_measure_at_consumed_output``).

Four invariants per bill version:

1. **Schema-valid** — every node validates against the published ``TreeNode`` def.
2. **Valid level** — every node's ``level`` is in the shared GPO enum.
3. **Money conservation** — the union of per-node ``own_amounts`` never over-counts;
   drops are bounded by a documented per-bill registry. XML measures against the
   INDEPENDENT raw-XML body (the strong gate — ``full_text`` is derived from the same
   nodes, so measuring there would tautologically pass over dropped money). PDF has
   no independent ground truth, so it measures against its own ``full_text`` (the
   documented carve-out) — a labeled span check, weaker by construction.
4. **No blank-label TOC rows** — the leveled TOC the tree renders carries no blank
   clickable rows or empty groups (``feedback_validate_against_hard_fixture``: the
   consumed-output form of the blank-row invariant).

The gates parametrize over the COMMITTED corpus manifest (tests/corpus_manifest.toml),
so the collected set is identical on every machine and runs in CI; the completeness
floor fails closed if a manifested fixture is uncommitted (ADR 0015). CORPUS_SWEEP=1
runs the broad local glob instead, for opt-in, non-CI exploration.

# holds == 0 corpus-wide; these budgets bound only DROPS. A version not listed must
# conserve EXACTLY (drop == 0). Listed versions carry a documented residue equal to
# the observed drop, so any future regression that drops MORE trips the gate.
#
# The drops are PRE-EXISTING parser body-coverage residue, NOT introduced by the
# tree: own_amounts come from each node's display_text, so a drop is an amount the
# parser never placed in a node — the same gap test_every_dollar_amount_appears_in_a_
# node already tolerates at its 0.80 floor. The shapes are the hard ones the plan's
# 0009 posture flags: engrossed/enrolled amendment docs, multi-division omnibus, and
# the 119-hr-1 reconciliation bill (not an appropriations bill; in the corpus only as
# an overfitting smoke test). Chasing them is the financial-semantics epic (#147), not
