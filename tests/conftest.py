# --- Content-skip ceiling (#220) -----------------------------------------------
# The #217 manifest floor proves fixtures are committed and cases collected, but not
# that any ASSERTION ran. The corpus gates skip per-case on content conditions ("no
# bill body", "no dollar amounts", "no anchors / no offset table"), so a corpus-wide
# parser regression that turned every case into a content-skip would keep CI green
# while asserting nothing — the one structural fail-open the manifest floor leaves open.
#
# This closes that channel: every content-skip in the modules below must be named in
# ALLOWED_CORPUS_SKIPS, AND skip for the reason recorded there. An unlisted skip fails
# the session; so does an allowlisted nodeid that starts skipping for a different
# reason (a bare count, or a nodeid-only match, would miss both — the second is
# precisely a regression on a case already known to be fragile).
#
# Adding an entry is a deliberate act: it records a fixture the gates cannot assert
# on, which is a coverage gap, not a neutral fact. Say why in the comment.
#
# Scope: the three gates that skip per-case on content.
#
# test_financial_callout_whole_item was watched here for a fixture-ABSENCE channel
# (its XML cases carried skipif(not (_V1.exists() and _V2.exists()))). It was removed
# with the financial callout it asserted on (#671), so there is no longer a module to
# watch. The 119-hr-1 fixtures it named are still committed and manifested, and the
# #217 fixture floor covers them; nothing is left uncovered by dropping the entry.
#
# Why not watch the other corpus modules: test_node_join_corpus,
# test_xml_subsection_nodes, test_pdf_subsection_recall and
# test_pdf_xml_withheld_recall hard-assert denominators instead of skipping, so
# they have no content-skip channel. The last of those reads one fixture named in the
# manifest and carries no skipif at all: a deleted fixture raises rather than skips,
# so there is nothing here to allow. Left out deliberately; add one here if any of

# --- The CI slow suite (#288) ---------------------------------------------------
# These @slow modules run against committed fixtures and are named by a CI step.
# Committing a fixture makes a gate RUNNABLE; only naming its module in the workflow
# makes it RUN — the same distinction #220 called out for the corpus gates.
# History: #288 — named by no CI step, their assertions passed on any fresh clone and
# never once ran in CI.
#
# They are watched here for the same reason the corpus gates are: adding a module to CI
# also adds its skip channel to CI, and a skip asserts nothing. Kept as a SEPARATE
# allowlist from ALLOWED_CORPUS_SKIPS deliberately. Those entries are content
# properties — permanent, correct facts about a fixture. Every entry below is instead a
# fixture this repo does not commit, so each one is a coverage gap that should SHRINK as
# #126 curates the corpus. Merging the two dicts would lose exactly that distinction and
# make the temporary look permanent.
#
# NOTE on blast radius: this tuple is read by pytest_runtest_logreport, which runs in
# EVERY session, not only the slow step that gates these modules. So listing a module
# here also watches its NON-slow cases in the fast run. That is the intended reach (a
# skip asserts nothing wherever it happens), but it means a module's whole skip surface
# has to be declared, not just the part the slow step collects — see the
# test_bill_tree.py entry below, which skips in the fast tier.

# --- Fast-tier PDF gates -------------------------------------------------------
# The two ceilings above watch the corpus gates and the modules the slow CI steps name.
# Neither reaches these, because they carry no `slow` marker and so run in the FAST step
# (`pytest -m "not slow and not browser"`) — they were RUNNING in CI all along, but their
# skips were declared nowhere and could drift silently. That is the same fail-open channel
# #220 and #288 closed, in the one tier neither covered.
#
# A THIRD group rather than more entries in CI_SLOW_MODULES, because that tuple's name is
# load-bearing: it means "named by a slow CI step", and the comment above it reasons from
# that. Filing fast-tier modules there would make the name false for a third of its
# contents and quietly break the next reader's model of which step a skip belongs to.
#
# test_pdf_division_recall.py is deliberately ABSENT: every skip channel it once carried
# is now an assertion rather than a skip (the #141 zero-anchor channel, and the two
# pytest.skip() guards on manifested fixtures in _fixture() and
# test_single_division_bill_has_no_division_labels — #539), so it has no skip surface to
# declare. Adding it would be inert today and would invite re-opening a skip later as the
# cheap way to green it.
#
# test_pdf_text.py (#539): 18 modules skipped their way to a green run with no watch on any
# of them. Of those, this was the one with a live, currently-firing skip: 115-hr-5895 v3
# (Placed on Calendar, Senate) was not manifested, so TestUnbulletedFooterConsumedOutput's
# skipif fired on every run and the #140 footer-strip regression gate had never once
# asserted in CI — a shipped fix with no live guard, reported as a green run.
#
# The v3 PDF is committed now (manifested PDF-only, ~355 KB), so those two cases EXECUTE
# rather than skip and the allowlist below is empty. That is the point of the fix: the
# earlier draft of this change declared the absence as permanent, which would have made
# the dead guard visible but kept it dead. "The stage was never added to the corpus"
# described the corpus's history, not a constraint on it.
#
# So this module now has NO declared skip, and must not acquire one: every skip channel it
# carries (the v3 skipif, and the three _HR8752_V1 guards) keys on a manifested fixture, so
# any of them firing means a fixture went missing, not a documented gap. Declaring one here
# to green a run would restore exactly the channel #539 closed — commit the fixture instead.

# in CI; 115-hr-5895 v3 was the #140 footer print (#539). All are committed now, so those
# cases assert instead of skipping.
#
# An empty allowlist is not an inert one: the group stays in _SKIP_WATCH_GROUPS, so the

# --- Cases CI can never collect ------------------------------------------------
# Every watched module parametrizes over the committed manifest EXCEPT the ones below,
# which build their case list from the bill trees directly (tests/pdf_corpus.py:
# dual_format_versions, adjacent_pdf_pairs). Their case list therefore grows with
# whatever a machine has fetched: for the two original modules, 6 and 30 cases in CI
# against 90 and 432 on a full working checkout. The prose gate added in #7 shares the
# amount gate's dual_format_versions denominator exactly, so it expands the same way.
#
# That breaks the assumption the allowlist rests on. An allowlist calibrated against the
# committed corpus cannot name cases that only exist on one developer's disk, so those
# skips read as undeclared and the session fails — locally red while CI is green, on a
# branch where nothing is wrong. A ceiling that cries wolf on every maintainer's machine
# gets muted, which costs more than the channel it guards.
#
# So for these modules a case is watched only if the manifest declares every FILE the
# case reads. A case CI cannot collect cannot regress in CI, and there is nothing
# meaningful to declare about it. Cases that ARE manifested stay watched exactly as
# before, so the channel is narrowed to what CI runs, not switched off. This is the same
# reasoning that already exempts CORPUS_SWEEP: a superset sweep is uncalibrated by
# construction.
#
# Format matters, and collapsing it is the trap here. The manifest declares (bill, stage,
# FORMAT), and five of the 57 manifested versions are deliberately committed in one format
# only -- the five #519 engrossed amendments are xml-only. The amount-recall
# gate reads the xml AND the pdf of a stage, so a single-format stage yields no case in CI
# even though the manifest names it. Each module therefore declares which formats its
# cases actually need.

# History: #220 put every corpus correctness gate on the committed manifest and #278
# committed the Legislative Branch validation set, retiring REQUIRE_CORPUS from here.
#
# The marker alone does not deselect: `-m slow` (what CI runs) would select the parity
# gate right along with everything else, so the requirement has to be enforced at
# collection, not by marker expression. `--run-network` opts in; `-m "not network"`
# still deselects outright.
#
# It is kept out of the PR gates deliberately: a pull request should not go red because a
# third-party service is down, and a naming change on govinfo's side is not something a

# contributor's machine may lack Playwright, but under that CI step a skip is a
# silent no-op: every test "passes" by skipping and the step reports green while
# asserting nothing. `--run-browser` is the CI step's signal to treat a launch
# failure as a test failure instead. A flag rather than an env var, mirroring
# `--run-network`: the distinction is an invocation, not an environment.
#
# The Python-package channel needs no guard: `importorskip("playwright")` skips the
# whole module at collection if the package is missing, but CI's preceding
# `playwright install chromium` step would already fail loudly if the package were
# absent from the environment, so that channel cannot silently no-op.
