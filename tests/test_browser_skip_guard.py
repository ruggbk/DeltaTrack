"""The `browser` tier fails closed under `--run-browser` (#599).

CI's dedicated browser step exists to run the Playwright tests with Chromium
present. Its launch helper — the module-scoped `chromium` fixture in both browser
modules — skips when the browser can't start: the right behavior for the default
`-m "not slow and not browser"` tier, where a contributor's machine may lack
Playwright, but a silent no-op under that CI step, where every test "passes" by
skipping and the step reports green while asserting nothing.

`--run-browser` is the CI step's signal (ci.yml): when set, a launch failure
raises instead of skipping, so a drifted or uninstallable Chromium reddens CI
instead of being reported as a clean pass. These tests prove the flag flips each
module's fixture from skip to raise, in both directions — a guard that has never
fired in the raise direction cannot distinguish "Chromium is fine" from "the
guard is broken".

The module-level ``importorskip("playwright")`` needs no counterpart here: it
guards the Python *package*, which CI's preceding ``playwright install chromium``
step would already fail loudly on if missing (#599).
