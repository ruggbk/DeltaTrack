"""What the PDF extraction cache key must distinguish (#393).

`tests/pdf_corpus.cached_pages` persists extracted PDF text to disk so repeat runs
skip extraction. A cache entry is only safe to reuse when both halves of what produced
it are unchanged: the PDF, and the extractor. Keying on the PDF alone (path + mtime)
left the second half unchecked, so editing `parsers/pdf_text.py` did not invalidate
anything and the suites reading the cache asserted against pre-change text.

That failure mode is silent by construction: the tests do not skip, they pass. It hit
hardest in `test_pdf_anchor_golden.py`, which exists to go red on exactly this drift.

These tests use a throwaway file rather than a real PDF: `_cache_file` only stats the
path, so nothing here needs the corpus or an extraction.
