"""Browser-level (Playwright) tests for the static front-end (#69).

These cover what TestClient can't: real browser runtime behavior. #41 was a
browser-only bug — a sample-report popup opened on page load (outside a user
gesture) was blocked, stranding the user on the upload form. Only a real
browser reproduces popup-block semantics.

Marked ``browser``; excluded from the default suite. Run with::

    uv run playwright install chromium   # one-time, downloads the browser
    uv run pytest -m browser

Skipped entirely if Playwright or its browser binary isn't available, so the
default ``-m "not browser"`` run never depends on them.
