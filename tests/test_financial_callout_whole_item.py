"""#86 — whole-item added/removed amounts reach the financial callout.

Headline case, asserted at the consumed output (the rendered callout, per the
issue): 119-hr-1 reported-in-house -> engrossed-in-house, Sec. 20004 (a). Ground
truth is one changed pair ($250M -> $500M) and one removed item ($250M). Before
#86 the callout reported a lone +$250M and was silent on the removal; it must now
surface the -$250M removal and net to $0.

The list renumbering also emits a net-zero +/-$350M shuffle pair (a position
shuffle the word-diff juxtaposes). Cleaning that noise is #87's scope, so this
test deliberately does NOT assert those rows away — only that the real removal is
surfaced and the net is honest.
