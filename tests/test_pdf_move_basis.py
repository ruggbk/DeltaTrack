"""Slice 6a: the moved-vs-modified call is assignment's, and classification only reads it.

Before this slice, ``_hunk_for_paired_blocks`` compared a round-1 pairing's ``word_overlap``
against ``MOVE_THRESHOLD`` and decided ``moved`` vs ``modified`` there. That is a threshold over
correspondence evidence inside classification, which ADR 0020 invariant 6 forbids: every rule
deciding whether two observations *correspond*, or on what basis, belongs to assignment.

6a moves the rule and preserves it exactly. ``pdf_round1_move_basis`` applies it, reading named
evidence; the verdict travels as ``PdfSettledCorrespondence.move_basis``; classification emits.

**Why an output comparison cannot be the control here.** The policy is unchanged, so production
output is byte-identical either way — the canonical PDF baseline stays green whether the decision
happens in assignment or in classification. An output gate cannot test *which code applied a
rule*, a lesson this thread learned twice (research record §"An output gate cannot test which
code applied a rule"). So the controls below move the *decision* and watch classification follow,
contradict the evidence and require the basis to win, and read the shipped source statically.

The population itself is preserved by gates that already exist and are untouched:
``tests/test_pdf_canonical_baseline.py`` (byte digest over the corpus),
``tests/test_pdf_matching_boundary.py`` and ``tests/test_pdf_round2_stages.py`` (transcribed
pre-slice oracles, which still spell the *old* collapsed rule and still agree).
