"""Cross-pipeline change-parity + Senate size-band validation (#109, slice G).

The closing slice of the #54 leveled-heading-tree epic. It adds **no engine
code** — it validates the now-merged A–F output along the two axes slice G owns:

1. **Senate size-band-vs-XML-heading ratio** on the #89 residual pair
   ``118-s-4795`` (reported-in-Senate). ``scripts/heading_precision.py`` is the
   named acceptance tool; we reuse its ``measure`` oracle so the check tracks the
   tool, not a re-implementation. The ratio is PDF ``account`` anchors / XML leaf
   headings — recovery is "in range" when it sits near 1.0.

2. **Change parity** (MODIFIED/ADDED/REMOVED/MOVED totals per pipeline) across
   the four evidence bills, v1→v2 (reported→engrossed).

Exact cross-pipeline parity is **not** the invariant. Only the clean bill
(118-hr-8752, no prose-leading agencies) matches exactly; the others diverge by
design — the count-convergence framing was retired in #107 (the gap is PDF
segmentation granularity + division-collapse, not a bug). So the gate records the
observed per-pipeline totals as **attributed bands** (each carrying its cause),
asserts the totals stay inside them, and pins the clean bill to exact parity. The
bands are guardrail constants: a snug lower bound catches a silent collapse to
zero (``feedback_property_tests_fail_open`` — the fail-open trap), an upper bound
catches a regression. The human-readable snapshot + attribution live in
``docs/decisions/0014-leveled-heading-tree-scope.md``; regenerate with
``pytest -k parity -s``.

The clean-bill parity case (``118-hr-8752``) is committed in both XML and PDF via
the corpus manifest, and ``118-s-4795``'s XML is committed too, so those run on any
checkout. The other evidence bills and the watermarked Senate PDF (fetched via
``scripts/fetch_test_assets.py``) are uncommitted, so their cases skip when absent.
This module is not in the CI slow selection, so it gates on a full local run.
