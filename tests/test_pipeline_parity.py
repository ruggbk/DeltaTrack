"""Cross-pipeline change-parity + Senate size-band validation (#109, slice G).

The closing slice of the #54 leveled-heading-tree epic. It adds **no engine
code** — it validates the now-merged A–F output along the two axes slice G owns:

1. **Senate size-band-vs-XML-heading ratio** on the #89 residual pair
   ``118-s-4795`` (reported-in-Senate). ``scripts/heading_precision.py`` is the
   named acceptance tool; we reuse its ``measure`` oracle so the check tracks the
   tool, not a re-implementation. The ratio is PDF ``account`` anchors / XML leaf
   headings — recovery is "in range" when it sits near 1.0.

2. **Change parity** (MODIFIED/ADDED/REMOVED/MOVED totals per pipeline) across
   the four evidence bills, v1→v2 (reported→engrossed).

Exact cross-pipeline parity is **not** the invariant. Only the clean bill
(118-hr-8752, no prose-leading agencies) matches exactly; the others diverge by
design — the count-convergence framing was retired in #107 (the gap is PDF
segmentation granularity + division-collapse, not a bug). So the gate records the
observed per-pipeline totals as **attributed bands** (each carrying its cause),
asserts the totals stay inside them, and pins the clean bill to exact parity. The
bands are guardrail constants: a snug lower bound catches a silent collapse to
zero (``feedback_property_tests_fail_open`` — the fail-open trap), an upper bound
catches a regression. The human-readable snapshot + attribution live in
``docs/decisions/0014-leveled-heading-tree-scope.md``; regenerate with
``.venv/bin/python scripts/parity_table.py``.

That table used to be a case in this module. It asserted nothing — it printed what
the parametrized case below already computes — so it was reporting wearing a gate's
clothes, and as one monolithic test it was a hard floor on the suite's wall clock
(``pytest-xdist`` distributes whole tests). It moved to the script in #350, which
also owns the inputs both sides need (``PARITY_BILLS``, ``v1_v2``, ``totals``) so
the bill list has one home; ``test_band_table_covers_every_parity_bill`` keeps the
bands below from drifting away from it.

Every input is committed: all four evidence bills carry v1/v2 in both formats under
``tests/corpus/``, and the Senate pair is ``tests/corpus/118-s-4795`` XML plus
``test_data/BILLS-118s4795rs.pdf``. So every case runs on any checkout, and absence is
a hard failure on ``test_evidence_fixtures_committed`` rather than a skip (#326).
CI runs this module: it is named in the ``Run remaining slow suites (committed
fixtures)`` step of ``.github/workflows/ci.yml``. Committing a fixture makes a gate
runnable; naming its module is what makes it run (#220). So a case added here is
watched by CI, not local runs alone.
