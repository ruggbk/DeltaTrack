"""Guards for the committed corpus manifest and its fail-closed floor (#217).

These are fast (non-slow) on purpose, for two reasons:

1. The committed-fixture guarantee is checked on *every* CI run, not only in the
   slow corpus-gate step -- an uncommitted manifest fixture goes red in the fast
   job too, and cheaply.
2. The fail-closed guardrail itself (`assert_manifest_committed` /
   `missing_manifest_files`) gets a regression test. #217 exists to turn a missing
   fixture into a red build; a future refactor that quietly made that helper always
   pass would silently revert the gates to fail-open, and without these tests
   nothing would catch it.

# as the manifest guards above: the fixtures are committed, so a normal checkout has all
# of them and this is green; a rename/cleanup/.gitignore change that drops one must redden
# the fast job too, not wait for the slow validation step. Moved per maintainer review of
# #328. (Placed at the end of the file to minimize overlap with other in-flight work on
