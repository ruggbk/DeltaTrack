"""Slice 7: PDF round-1 retrieval as a named retriever emitting a ``CandidateSet``.

`_block_key` + `SequenceMatcher` + the positional `replace` zip are unchanged as *policy*. What
slice 7 adds is that what they considered is now **materialised** — a `CandidateSet` proposed
into under a named invocation — and that the materialisation is on the result-bearing path
rather than beside it.

**That distinction is the whole slice, and it is what these controls exist for.** A candidate
set built and then ignored is indistinguishable from a correct one by every gate that compares
output: the pairings, the hunks and the canonical digest are all identical whether evidence
consults the set or reconstructs the pair from the pairing stream. So the controls here are not
output comparisons. They are:

- withholding a candidate makes evidence **fail closed** rather than reconstruct;
- a candidate carrying the wrong invocation's provenance cannot authorize evidence;
- the set's canonical order cannot become the stream's order;
- revoked round-1 evidence is reachable after the stage completes;
- both retrievers actually fire on the committed corpus, so none of the above is vacuous.

Preservation of the population itself stays with the gates that already own it: gate 1's
canonical baseline and gate 6's crossing fixture for the positional rule.

**Retired in #659: the transcribed opcode walk.** Membership and provenance used to be compared
against a transcription of the pre-slice-7 aligner's opcode walk. That answered
whether slice 7 preserved behaviour -- a closed question -- and could not survive a deliberate
change to PDF round-1 retrieval without someone re-transcribing a new "before".

One coverage loss is deliberate and is recorded here rather than left to be rediscovered: no
gate now compares each pair's *attribution* against an independent expectation, so a pair
relabelled from ``positional_replace`` to ``block_key_alignment`` would leave the pairing
stream, the candidate set's membership, admission and the canonical digest all correct.
``test_both_round_1_retrievers_are_actually_exercised`` still refuses a rule that stops firing
altogether, which is the coarse half of the same claim.
