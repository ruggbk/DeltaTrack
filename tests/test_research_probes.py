"""Gates on the provision-matching research probes (``docs/research/provision-matching/probes``).

Those scripts are deliberately excluded from lint and format (``pyproject.toml``
``extend-exclude``) so they stay verbatim as the artifacts of a study. The 2026-08 methodology
review found what that exclusion cost: a pure rename in #492 broke the ``deltatrack`` imports of
thirteen of them, #308 moved the corpus out from under all fifteen, and nobody noticed for
months, because **nothing ran them**. ``paper.md``'s "every number can be reproduced from the
scripts named in Appendix A" was false at review time in the strongest sense -- none of them
executed at all.

Excluding a directory from lint is a decision about *style*. It should not also be a decision to
stop checking that the code resolves. These are the two checks that would have caught #492 and
#308 the day they landed, and they are deliberately narrow so the exclusion keeps its meaning:

1. every ``from deltatrack... import`` in the probes still resolves (static, executes nothing);
2. ``corpus_roots.py``, which every post-review probe reads its corpus through, is correct --
   because a stale or wrongly-ordered corpus view silently changes *every* research number
   downstream and raises nothing.

Both are static. Neither can see a probe that reaches a symbol by attribute rather than by import,
or one that calls a function whose signature moved -- the name still resolves, and only calling it
fails. That is a real limit, accepted deliberately: these gates serve the probes that support live
research, and a probe whose question has closed is deleted rather than kept running (AGENTS.md,
"Research artifacts are working material").

Nothing here asserts a research RESULT. Results live in the review document with the probe output
quoted; pinning them in CI would make an experiment into a regression test, which is the mistake
the review criticises elsewhere.
