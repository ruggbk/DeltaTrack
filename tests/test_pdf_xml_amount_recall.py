"""Structure-free cross-check: every dollar amount the XML parser extracts for a
bill version must also be recoverable from the PDF of the same version.

Why this works when structural diff parity does not (see
plans/test-coverage-expansion.md): PDFs are flat, GPO-line-numbered text with
none of the XML hierarchy, so block-level PDF hunks can't be mapped to
section-level XML nodes. But a dollar amount is an atomic token — it survives
the structural mismatch. The XML side is independently validated against a
curated spreadsheet (test_validate_extraction.py), so the XML amounts serve as
a structure-free oracle for the PDF text pipeline. A miss flags either:

  - a PDF extraction failure (a number split across a line wrap, dropped by
    page-chrome stripping, or mangled by glyph normalization), or
  - an XML over-extraction (a phantom amount the parser invented).

Both are real signals. The reverse direction (PDF carries amounts the XML
parser doesn't) is left diagnostic, not asserted: those extras are content the
XML parser intentionally skips (table of contents, quoted text) plus known
parser gaps tracked in test_corpus_properties.py.

Recall is compared at the level of distinct amount values: "is this value
present somewhere in the PDF?" — not multiset counts, which would false-positive
on legitimate repeats whose surrounding text the PDF joins differently.

Marked @slow: parses bill XML and extracts every PDF page.
