"""Unit tests for docs/research/financial-semantics/classify_bill.py — classify_text() behavior.

Covers every label outcome and the ordering/edge cases that matter:
- subsection prefix variants (RESTRICT, APPROP) — fixed in #115
- APPROP + RESCISSION interaction
- AUTHORIZATION ordering (fires after APPROP_ALT so hybrid nodes stay appropriation)
- RESTRICT_NOTWITHSTANDING
- unknown fallthrough
