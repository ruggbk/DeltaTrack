"""Derived sidecar tree for the leveled bill structure (#108).

Both pipelines keep emitting their flat lists (XML ``BillNode`` via
``bill_tree.normalize_bill``; PDF ``Anchor`` via ``parsers.pdf_anchors``). This
module reconstructs a navigable parent/child ``TreeNode`` tree FROM those flat
lists — the diff engine is untouched (it still matches per-node by
``match_path``). A tree-aware diff backbone is deferred; this tree + its tests +
the conservation gate are that future refactor's de-risking spec (ADR 0005/0006).

Structure is recovered from **division-qualified ``display_path`` prefix-nesting**:
interior levels (division, department, agency, grouping header) are not emitted as
their own nodes in the corpus — they exist only as ``display_path`` strings — so
each path prefix becomes a synthesized interior ``TreeNode`` and the path's flat
node becomes a content node. The leaf's typed ``tag`` refines only the leaf level;
interior levels are positional (#108 locked decision 1). Orphan titles are already
attributed to their division upstream in ``normalize_bill`` (their ``display_path``
carries the division prefix), so the builder needs no special orphan logic.

``level`` uses the shared GPO-grounded vocabulary documented in
``docs/bill-structure.md`` (division / title / major / agency / account / section /
grouping / preamble), so the canonical contract speaks one language both pipelines
map into (ADR 0006/0007 — no pipeline branch in the renderer).

Steps 1-2: the ``TreeNode`` type + the XML and PDF builders, sharing one trie
core. Per-block ``own_amounts`` + canonical ``tree`` spans (steps 3-4) land later.
