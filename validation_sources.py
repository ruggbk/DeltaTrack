"""Registry of committee-report validation sources (external ground truth for #8).

Each Jurisdiction pairs a Senate appropriations committee report with the reported bill
it explains. The builder (scripts/build_validation.py) reads the report and writes
test_data/validation_<slug>.json; tests/test_validate_extraction.py validates the bill
XML against it. All three tiers are committed: the report HTML (test_data/CRPT-*.htm),
the reported bill XML (tests/corpus/118-s-*/1_reported-in-senate.xml), and the JSON fixtures.
The `--fetch` flag re-obtains the upstream sources rather than supplying anything a
fresh clone lacks (ADR 0015 committed them so the gate runs on the same set everywhere
instead of on whatever each machine had downloaded).

To add a jurisdiction: find its FY2025 Senate report (CRPT-118srptNNN) and reported bill
(BILLS-118sNNNNrs), add an entry, then `uv run python scripts/build_validation.py --fetch`.
