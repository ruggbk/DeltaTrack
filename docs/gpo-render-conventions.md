# GPO bill render conventions

How the official GPO stylesheet renders legacy-DTD bill XML — the authoritative
rules for spacing, enum/header layout, casing, and front matter. We mirror these
in our XML render path so the full-bill view and diff match the published bill.

This is a **reference spec**, distilled from the stylesheet so we don't have to
run it. It backs issues #48 (front matter), #50 (title enum), #51 (spacing/lists),
#53 (casing), #58 (line numbers), #59 (quoted-block casing). Evaluation context: #40.

## What the GPO stylesheet is

Every bill in our corpus names its renderer in the XML prolog:

```
<!DOCTYPE bill PUBLIC "-//US Congress//DTDs/bill.dtd//EN" "bill.dtd">
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="billres.xsl"?>
```

This is the legacy **bill DTD** chain (not USLM). `billres.xsl` is a thin wrapper
that pulls in `billres-details.xsl` (~24.8k lines), the element-by-element render
templates. `table.xsl` handles tables (included at `billres-details.xsl:710`). The
styling that renders is an inline `<style>` block from `defineDocumentStyle`
(`billres-details.xsl:768`–1689); the bundled `bills.css` is a separate copy the
chain never links (see [How casing works](#how-casing-works-two-layers)).

- **It is XSLT 2.0.** Python `lxml`/libxslt is 1.0 only and cannot run it; running
  it needs Saxon (server-side only — never ship a JVM to the staffer path).
- **It is display-faithful, not diff-tuned.** Our extractor deliberately
  suppresses formatting noise for diff stability; GPO does not. Keep the two
  concerns separate (see #51): one normalized string for matching, one readable
  string for display.

### Where to get it / re-fetching for future updates

Vendored under `reference/gpo-bill-render/` (gitignored; public domain, 17 U.S.C.
§105). Source: <https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLS/resources/>. Fetch the full
bundle (`billres.xsl`, `billres-details.xsl`, `table.xsl`, the DTDs, and image
assets, plus `bills.css` as a non-linked reference copy) so it stays complete.
When GPO updates the stylesheet, re-fetch and re-verify this doc — **citations
below quote literal
snippets precisely so you can re-locate each rule by `grep` even if line numbers
shift.** Citations are `name (line) — "quote"`.

## How casing works: two layers

Casing is applied **twice** and you must read both to get the right answer:

1. **XSLT** — `convertToNeededCase` (`billres-details.xsl:8279`) transforms the
   text via `translate()` / `capitalizeReplacement` before it hits the DOM.
2. **CSS** — `text-transform` / `font-variant` on the element's class.

The CSS that renders is the **inline `<style>` block** from `defineDocumentStyle`
(`billres-details.xsl:767`; it spans 768–1689), the only stylesheet in the output.
**`bills.css` is never linked** by the chain (`billres.xsl` → `billres-details.xsl`
→ `table.xsl`); it's an externalized copy of the same classes that has **drifted**
from the inline block for several of them, so reading it gives wrong answers (see
Gotchas). For our HTML output we can reproduce GPO faithfully by applying the same
CSS classes (`font-variant: small-caps` etc.) rather than string-uppercasing.

## Front matter (#48)

`<form>` and the enacting clause, everything before the bill body.

- **`<form>` children render in a fixed, stage-dependent sequence — NOT document
  order.** `form` (`billres-details.xsl:3435`) is a large `xsl:choose` branching on
  document stage (introduced / reported / engrossed / enrolled / …). Common
  non-enrolled order: calendar (right-aligned) → congress/session → legis-num →
  action → `<hr>` → legis-type → official-title.
- **Enacting clause is GPO-injected boilerplate, not from `<enacting-clause>`.**
  Variable `$enact` (`billres-details.xsl:713`) — literal
  `" Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, "` —
  rendered as `<em>` at the **top of `legis-body`**, suppressed when
  `legis-body/@display-enacting-clause = 'no-display-enacting-clause'`. Wire it to
  the legis-body render, not the form block.
- **`<legis-type>` ("AN ACT" / "A BILL"), `<congress>`, `<session>` render
  verbatim** for non-enrolled stages — no synthesis. (Only enrolled bills swap in
  images / boilerplate like "AT THE SECOND SESSION".)
- **`<distribution-code>` renders nothing** — `match="distribution-code"`
  (`billres-details.xsl:20863`) is an empty template. Drop it from front-matter text.
- **`<official-title>` renders verbatim**, no casing transform.

| Element | Source of text | GPO injects? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `distribution-code` | — | — | empty template; nothing renders |
| `calendar` | XML verbatim | no | right-aligned, first |
| `congress` / `session` | XML verbatim | no | small-caps (non-enrolled) |
| `legis-num` | XML verbatim | no | font size by string length |
| `legis-type` | XML verbatim | no | must already contain "AN ACT"/"A BILL" |
| `official-title` | XML verbatim | no | hanging indent, no transform |
| enacting clause | **stylesheet `$enact`** | **yes** | top of `legis-body`, not `<form>` |

---

## Structural hierarchy: enum + header (#50)

Each level injects a literal **wrapper word** before the enum and an **em-dash
`—`** before the header, rendered on one line. The header text is recased per the
casing table below.

| Level | Wrapper word | Sep. | Enum class / casing | Header casing | XSL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<title>` | `TITLE ` | `—` | small-caps (`lbexTitleLevelTrad`) | UPPERCASE (`translate`) | `displayEnumTitle` (5540) — `"TITLE "` (5582, approp branch) |
| `<subtitle>` | `subtitle ` | `—` | capitalize | title-case | enum 5707 |
| `<division>` | `DIVISION ` | `—` | uppercase | UPPERCASE | enum 18856 |
| `<part>` | `Part ` | `—` | small-caps | small-caps | enum 5790 |
| `<chapter>` | `chapter ` | `—` | uppercase | uppercase | enum 6016 |
| `<section>` | `Sec. ` | space | small-caps (`lbexInitialCapTrad`) | UPPERCASE | `displayEnumSection` (5127; trad/approp branch 5319) — `"Sec. "` |

Output shape for a title: `TITLE I—AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS` (no spaces flanking the
em-dash; both on one centered line via `BigHeads`, `billres-details.xsl:9337`).

> **Note for our parser:** we currently emit only the `<header>` for titles and
> drop the enum entirely (#50). Reconstruct `TITLE {enum}—{HEADER}`.

---

## Casing rules (#53)

Per-level, **not a blanket uppercase.** Authority depends on level:
`convertToNeededCase` (`billres-details.xsl:8279`) governs `appropriations-major` /
`-intermediate` / `-small`; `displayHeaderTitle` (7292) and `displayHeaderSection`
(6913) uppercase `<title>` / `<section>` headers (via `translate(., $lower, $upper)`
or an uppercase class like `lbexAllcapnormal`). CSS is the inline block
(`defineDocumentStyle`, 768–1689; approp header classes at 1361+).

| Level | XSLT transform | CSS | Visual result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `appropriations-major` header | `translate($lower,$upper)` → UPPER | `text-transform:uppercase` | ALL CAPS |
| `appropriations-intermediate` header | `capitalizeReplacement` → title-case | `font-variant:small-caps` | title-case shown in **small-caps** |
| `appropriations-small` header | `translate($upper,$lower)` → lower | `small-caps` + `text-transform:lowercase` | lowercase in small-caps |
| `<section>` enum | literal `Sec. ` | `small-caps` (`lbexInitialCapTrad`, 5319) | `Sec. 401` shown as small-caps "SEC. 401" |
| `<title>` header | `translate($lower,$upper)` → UPPER | — | ALL CAPS |
| `<short-title>`, `<official-title>` | none | none | **verbatim — do not transform** |

`convertToNeededCase` (`billres-details.xsl:8279`):
```
<xsl:when test="ancestor::appropriations-major">
  ... header → translate($theActualTextToPrint, $lower, $upper) ...
<xsl:when test="ancestor::appropriations-intermediate">
  ... header → capitalizeReplacement ...
<xsl:when test="ancestor::appropriations-small">
  translate($theActualTextToPrint, $upper, $lower)
```

### Rationale & the trap that bit #53

The source XML stores intermediate/section headers in **sentence case** ("Office
of the secretary", `Sec. 401`). GPO does **not** uppercase them — it title-cases
(intermediate) or leaves them (section) and renders with `font-variant: small-caps`,
which *displays* lowercase letters as small capitals. To the eye that reads as
"ALL CAPS," but the underlying text is not uppercase.

Our **PDF path reads real capitals**, because PDF text extraction flattens
small-caps glyphs to actual uppercase. So:

- **Do not** "fix" the XML path by uppercasing the literal strings (the original
  #53 acceptance said `Sec. 401 → SEC. 401` — that was wrong). Apply GPO's CSS
  classes instead.
- **Parity caveat:** after this, PDF (real caps) and XML (title/sentence case in
  small-caps) hold *different underlying text* that matches only visually. Fine for
  diff-matching (already case-normalized); flag it so it isn't mistaken for a bug.

## PDF consequence: heading levels extract at a smaller glyph size (#49/#54/#56/#89)

There is a **measured, empirical** size signal in the **PDF** path that we use to segment
headings: body prose extracts at one size and the appropriations heading levels (agency +
account) at a distinct smaller band. Measured on the corpus working stages: **body ≈
14.0pt, heading band ≈ 11.2pt** (ratio ≈ 0.8); the band-line count tracks XML
`intermediate+small` within ~15%, and `extract_anchors` (`src/deltatrack/parsers/pdf_anchors.py`) keys
account detection off it (#89).

> **Correction (#89): the mechanism is GPO's PDF typesetting, NOT the CSS small-caps
> cascade — and CSS `em` values must never seed thresholds.** An earlier version of this
> note attributed the smaller size to `font-variant: small-caps` rendering at x-height.
> The GPO HTML source refutes that: in `bills.css`, `appropriations-major` is uppercase
> **1.15em**, `appropriations-intermediate` (agency) is small-caps **1.15em** (*larger*
> than body), and `appropriations-small` (account) is uppercase **0.8em** (and *not*
> small-caps). Those `em` values predict agency > body > account, but we **measure** agency
> ≈ account ≈ 11.2 < body 14.0. The published PDF is typeset by GPO's separate
> photocomposition system, whose point sizes do not track the HTML renderer's `em` values
> (the `lbex*` class names mirror typesetting locators, not sizes). So: trust the measured
> PDF sizes, derive the band **per document** from measurement, and never port CSS `em`
> values into thresholds.

This lets PDF heading segmentation recover the hierarchy XML carries explicitly:
- `size == body AND uppercase` → `appropriations-major` (or a title/section header).
- `size < body` (the heading band) → `intermediate` / `small`. Split the two by
  position: the leaf (`small`/account) is immediately followed by body prose; the parent
  (`intermediate`/agency) is followed by another same-size heading.
- `size == body AND has lowercase` → body prose.

The true glyph size is **not** `FPDFText_GetFontSize` (returns 1.0 — GPO defines the font
at size 1 and scales via the text matrix); recover it from `FPDFText_GetMatrix`.

**Universal across stages, but base size varies.** The body↔heading ratio holds at every
stage; only the absolute sizes shift. Working stages: body 14pt, band 11.2pt. Enrolled
bills are re-typeset smaller: body 10pt, band 8pt — still ~0.8. So the threshold must be
derived per-document (and, for heterogeneous files, per-region), never hardcoded.

**Heterogeneous later stages need region-aware derivation.** Enrolled bills bundle a
large explanatory statement, and engrossed-amendment versions consolidate many divisions,
so a single global size split is muddied by extra matter at the heading size. The signal
is present; isolating it there requires the production extractor's chrome-strip + line
merge (`src/deltatrack/parsers/pdf_text`), not a global histogram. See
`plans/pdf-heading-segmentation-spike.md` for the investigation behind this signal.

## Inline spacing & lists (#51)

- **One ASCII space after every `<enum>`** when the next sibling is `<text>` or
  `<header>`. `displayEnum` (rule at `billres-details.xsl:5070`):
  ```
  <xsl:when test="local-name(following-sibling::*[1]) = 'text' or local-name(following-sibling::*[1]) = 'header'">
      <xsl:text> </xsl:text>
  ```
  This is authoritative — `(a)The` is a real defect; it should be `(a) The`.
- **Each structural level is its own block on its own line**, indented by a fixed
  ladder (inline block `billres-details.xsl:837`+, mirrored in `bills.css:513`+; all
  `text-indent:2em` hanging):

  | Level | `margin-left` |
  |---|---|
  | subsection | 0em |
  | paragraph | 2em |
  | subparagraph | 4em |
  | clause | 6em |
  | subclause | 8em |
  | item | 10em |
  | subitem | 12em |

  This is why list items appear on their own lines — block structure, not line-break
  tags.
- **`<linebreak>` / `<pagebreak>` are no-ops** in the renderer — they apply children
  (usually empty) and emit nothing. `billres-details.xsl:18461` / `:18464`:
  ```
  <xsl:template match="linebreak">
      <xsl:apply-templates/>
  </xsl:template>
  <xsl:template match="pagebreak">
      <xsl:apply-templates/>
  </xsl:template>
  ```
  Our "treat as whitespace" handling is consistent — no change needed.
- **Exception:** elements with `@display-inline='yes-display-inline'` render inline
  (no wrapping block) — for continuation runs.

---

## Quoted text casing (#59)

`<quote>` and `<quoted-block>` have **no dedicated casing class** — they inherit
from their container. Inside an `appropriations-major` block (`text-transform:
uppercase`) quoted text is uppercased by inheritance; inside an intermediate block
it's small-caps. If #53 adopts GPO's container-casing CSS verbatim, quoted text
nested in a cased header can be unintentionally re-cased. Decide deliberately:
scope the transform to the heading text, or mirror GPO's inheritance. Add a fixture
covering a quoted block inside a cased header.

---

## Not produced by the stylesheet

- **Line numbers (#58).** No `xsl:number`, `counter()`, `@line`, or line-number
  logic anywhere in `billres-details.xsl` / `bills.css`. The 1–25 line numbers in
  published bills are a downstream **print-composition artifact** (XSL-FO /
  proprietary typesetting), not part of the HTML render chain, and the bill XML
  carries no `@line` attributes. An XML/full-bill line-number column would have to
  be **synthesized** by us and would not match the PDF's print line breaks. PDF
  line numbers come only from the PDF itself.

---

## Gotchas (verified surprises)

1. **`bills.css` disagrees with the inline (rendering) block on two approp header
   classes, and `bills.css` doesn't render** — so the inline block is authoritative:
   `lbexHeaderAppropSmall` is `uppercase` in `bills.css` but **`lowercase`** inline
   (1381); `lbexHeaderAppropIntermediate` has no transform in `bills.css` but
   **`capitalize`** inline (1370). `lbexHeaderAppropMajor` agrees (both `uppercase`).
   Always read the inline block (`defineDocumentStyle`, 768–1689).
2. **"Sec." vs "SEC." is small-caps, not real caps** — see #53 rationale. The same
   applies to the title wrapper word.
3. **`appropriations-small` is lowercased then small-capped** — XSLT forces
   lowercase so CSS is the sole case authority.
4. **Enacting clause belongs to `legis-body`, not `form`** — and its text is the
   stylesheet's, not the XML's.
5. **`subtitle` wrapper is lowercase `subtitle `** + `capitalize` CSS — "SUBTITLE"
   in a published bill is the CSS transform, not a hardcoded string.
6. **`capitalize` is commented out only in `bills.css`; the inline block keeps it
   active.** Inline `lbexPartlevelTrad` (1172) and `lbexSectionTitleTrad` (1127) are
   `small-caps` **plus `text-transform: capitalize`**, so the live render title-cases
   these; it does **not** fall back to bare small-caps over the raw XML.
   (`lbexPartlevelTrad` is the part *enum* class, `displayEnumPart` 5822, not a header
   class.)

## Re-verification

After re-fetching the stylesheet (or to audit this doc): for each rule, `grep` the
quoted snippet or template name in `reference/gpo-bill-render/billres-details.xsl`
(or `bills.css`) and confirm the line + behavior still hold. The literal quotes are
the stable anchors; line numbers are a convenience that may drift.
