"""Blind labeling worklist generator (protocol §2 artifact 2, §5).

Renders every mined candidate into a worklist the human (and the LLM second opinion) labels
WITHOUT seeing the scores under test. The anti-circularity guard: validating a measure against
labels the measure influenced is worthless, so at label time the labeler sees only:
  - the two texts,
  - the structural breadcrumb (division › agency › account › section) for each side,
  - bill / version metadata.
It does NOT see word-overlap / containment / cosine, the current matcher's decision, or any
mining artifact that hints the expected answer (the `measures` block, `extra.construction` /
`extra.fan_in` / `extra.regime`, or the mining-flavored `change_type`). Structural *context*
is shown on purpose — it is the ground-truth signal a human legitimately uses (#170's thesis).

Candidates are interleaved across strata (deterministic id hash) so the labeler is not primed
by a run of same-stratum items. Each entry carries its stratum's label options and blank
`label` / `confidence` / `rationale` / `labeler` fields.

Outputs:
  - worklist.json         — the machine-fillable blind worklist (human + LLM both label this)
  - worklist_sample.md    — a few entries per stratum, human-readable, for the §10.3 pre-review

Run (from repo root, repo venv; needs the candidate pools + split_assignment.json):
