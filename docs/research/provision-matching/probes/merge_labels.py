"""Merge per-reviewer label files, measure agreement, and surface disagreements (protocol §8).

Reviewers send back `labels_<name>.json` (exported by the HTML form). Drop them in a `labels/`
subdirectory. This joins them by candidate id and produces `merged_labels.json`:

  - every id -> the list of (reviewer, label, confidence, rationale) it received;
  - on the OVERLAP set (ids labeled by >= 2 reviewers): raw agreement + mean pairwise Cohen's
    kappa PER STRATUM (pooling across the different label spaces would trigger the kappa paradox),
    each with its support count (overlap is only ~6-9 items/stratum, so the count matters, §7);
  - `needs_adjudication` flags each HUMAN-driven ambiguity (a human-human disagreement, or an
    all-low-confidence id) for Will's final ruling, recorded later in the fixture's `adjudication`.

The LLM second opinion (§8) writes a `labels_llm.json` in the same shape and merges here too, in
two never-conflated roles, both reported SEPARATELY and never voting in the human number:
  1. per-pair disagreement-flagger — `llm_label` / `llm_disagrees` on every id (including the many
     SOLO round-robin ids), collected in `llm_disagreements`. It is a flag for Will's attention,
     kept distinct from `needs_adjudication` (correlated-error caveat: weaker evidence than a
     human-human disagreement — and Will records his ruling BEFORE reading the LLM rationale).
  2. per-reviewer reliability screen — two-tailed LLM-agreement (see `_llm_reliability`).
Reliability != validity: high LLM agreement is weak evidence (it may be two correlated errors),
low agreement is the informative signal. Never read agreement as "the label is correct."

    For each human reviewer, compare their label to the LLM's on every id they BOTH labeled (within
    a stratum — label spaces differ), micro-averaged across strata for the overall rate. Because the
    LLM labels the whole worklist, this compares each reviewer's FULL shard, not just the ~24-item
    human overlap — a denser reliability signal than the human kappa.

    Flags are triage, not verdicts:
      * `low_engagement`  — overall agreement at/below _LOW_FLOOR and below the LEAVE-ONE-OUT cohort
        mean (the reviewer under test is excluded from the mean they are judged against, so a lone
        low outlier can't hide inside its own average). Also fired per stratum.
      * `possible_llm_delegation` — overall agreement at/above _HIGH_DELEGATION: the reviewer may have
        delegated to an LLM (they then correlate with THIS LLM on the shared-cite false-keeps — the
        worst case for the dataset's independence, per the correlated-error caveat).
      * `near_constant@<stratum>` — the reviewer's labels in a stratum are near-constant (low entropy)
        despite adequate support; a constant-responder that raw agreement alone would miss.
    HIGH agreement is never evidence a label is correct; LOW agreement is the informative signal.
    In SOLO mode (one reviewer) there is no cohort, so the cohort-RELATIVE comparison is dead and
    there is no human kappa; `low_engagement` still fires on the ABSOLUTE floor alone and
    `possible_llm_delegation` still fires, but lean on per-stratum entropy/marginals + rationale
