"""Miner: many-to-one CONSOLIDATION candidates (protocol §3, second priority stratum).

The §6.4 "absorbed into" case. On 119-hr-1's Senate rewrite (v3 placed-on-calendar-senate ->
v4 engrossed-amendment-senate) sections are renumbered and text recycled, so the match_path
join shatters: the current matcher shows a flood of removed+added. Rare-token containment
re-pairs many of the renumbered-recycled provisions the word-overlap rescue (>= 0.6) misses.

Each re-paired old-provision -> new-section pair is a candidate the human rules:
  - genuinely-absorbed = the old provision's statutory target substantively appears in the new
    section (a real many-to-one consolidation), OR
  - coincidentally-contained = containment is driven by a shared boilerplate citation with no
    substantive continuation (this is the false-keep positive, §5 label mapping).

So this stratum feeds BOTH the consolidation bucket and the high-containment-different
false-keep test. `fan_in` (how many old provisions map to the same new section) is recorded
as context: fan-in > 1 is the consolidation signature; a shared-citation cluster (§6.4's five
subsections each citing "Section 455(a)") is the coincidental-containment trap.

Held-out limitation (protocol §6): consolidation exists only in 119-hr-1 in the curated pool,
a Pass-1 "seen" bill forced to dev, so this stratum has a dev number but no held-out
counterpart. bills_corpus contains other big-rewrite bills (NDAAs etc.) that may supply a
second consolidation-bearing bill; that is flagged for follow-up, not mined here.

Emits an UNLABELED pool; `measures` is analysis-only and stripped before labeling (§5).
