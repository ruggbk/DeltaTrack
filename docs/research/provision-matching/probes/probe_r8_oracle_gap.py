"""R8: can a union of retrievers serve as the ORACLE for whether a counterpart exists?

The revised Study 2 design moved the ground-truth unit from matcher-produced pairs to old-version
anchors, then proposed showing the human ~8 candidates retrieved by a UNION of structural path,
word overlap and containment, and asking SAME / NONE / MANY. The second review objected that a
union of retrievers is still a retriever: if all three miss the true counterpart, the human sees
NONE, the dataset records "no counterpart", and candidate recall computed from that dataset is
100% by construction. The candidate system would have defined its own ground truth.

The objection is obviously right in principle. This probe asks whether it BITES in practice, and
then measures what the cheapest independent alternative would actually cost.

SECTION 1 -- is the union@8 exhaustive?
  A fourth signal is held out of the union: EXACT HEADER-TEXT EQUALITY between the anchor and a
  candidate. Nothing in the three retrievers uses it directly. Any anchor with a header-identical
  candidate in the new version that the union@8 does NOT surface is a demonstration that the
  suggestion list is not exhaustive over plainly-relevant candidates.

  This is a LOWER BOUND on the hole, not a count of missed counterparts. A header-identical
  candidate need not be the true counterpart, and a true counterpart need not share a header. The
  claim it supports is only the one at issue: "not retrieved" cannot mean "does not exist".

SECTION 2 -- what would an independent oracle cost?
  If the union cannot establish existence, something exhaustive must. Full-document review is the
  obvious answer and is too expensive to be the default. The cheaper one is REGION-EXHAUSTIVE
  review: the human reviews every provision in a bounded structural region of the new version, so
  "none" means none-in-region, stated against a named bound. Whether that is cheap is an empirical
  question about how big those regions are in real bills, and it is measured here rather than
  assumed, at three bounding levels.
