"""Hard-case stress test: 119-hr-1 v3 (placed-on-calendar-senate) vs v4 (engrossed-amendment-senate).

This is the Senate rewrite/consolidation: sections renumbered, much text recycled. (The
v4->v5 enrolled step is nearly identical; the churn is at v3->v4, which then carries into v5.)
Because match_path bakes in the section number, renumbering breaks the join -> the current
matcher should show a flood of removed+added, with reconcile_moves (word-overlap >= 0.6)
rescuing only some. We test whether rare-token containment re-pairs the recycled-but-
renumbered sections the current word-overlap rescue misses.
