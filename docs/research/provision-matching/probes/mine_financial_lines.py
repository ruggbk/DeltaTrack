"""Miner: FINANCIAL-LINE candidates (Pass 2 priority stream — appropriations focus).

Appropriations financial tables are DeltaTrack's primary value: a staffer needs the money
diff to read "$1,000,000 -> $1,200,000 for account X", not "removed $1,000,000 / added
$1,200,000". So matching financial lines correctly across versions is critical, and it is a
DIFFERENT regime from the text-provision strata: on a short account line the only substantive
change is the dollar amount, so word-overlap (not rare-token containment) is the signal that
matters (paper §7), and a large amount swap can drop word-overlap below the split threshold.

Two regimes, both drawn from the curated appropriations bills in `bills/` (every directory with
>= 2 versions — see `_approps_bills()`; the set grows as bills are added), across ALL adjacent
version pairs (the money negotiation happens House->Senate->conference->enrolled, not the first pair):
  - amount-edit-kept   = a `modified` financial node whose amounts changed. The matcher kept
    the pair; the human confirms it is genuinely the SAME account with an amount edit (vs a
    reused line for a different account). Calibrates the amount-edit "same" regime and anchors
    the failure mode #203 §3 lists as "amount-only edit".
  - amount-edit-split  = a removed financial node re-paired to an added financial node by text
    similarity (>= 0.5) with amounts on both sides. Candidate "same account, amount edit,
    WRONGLY split" — the false-split the amount swap causes. The valuable failure case.

`extra` records the amount pairing and whether the edit is amount-only (text identical once
amounts are masked) — the cleanest word-overlap-only regime. Emits an UNLABELED pool;
`measures` is analysis-only, stripped before labeling (§5).
