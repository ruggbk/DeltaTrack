"""R3: does the financial-line miner exclude the failure class it exists to measure?

`mine_financial_lines.py` finds "amount-edit-split" candidates -- a removed financial node
re-paired to an added financial node -- but only considers a pairing once its WORD similarity
clears `SPLIT_SIM = 0.50`. Tanker, the paper's own canonical same-account false split, scores
word-overlap 0.255. If the floor really does gate discovery, the miner cannot surface the
severe end of the very class it is built to sample.

Two things this measures, both on the union corpus (see corpus_roots):

  1. DISCOVERY GATE. For every removed financial node, the best available added partner by word
     overlap and, separately, by rare-token containment. How many have a strong containment
     partner but fall under the 0.50 word floor -- i.e. are invisible to the miner? Containment
     is used here only as an INDEPENDENT second opinion for triage; it is not ground truth, and
     nothing below is a labeled "same".

  2. TEXT SOURCE. Production extracts amounts from `amount_source_old/new`; the miner extracts
     from `old_text/new_text`. NodeDiff documents the two as a no-op on the current corpus and
     pins it with a regression test. This re-derives that agreement independently rather than
     trusting the comment, and reports any node where the two sources disagree.
