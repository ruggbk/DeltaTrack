"""R9: what uniquely identifies one parsed node, and does the candidate identifier hold up?

Two questions, and round 3 only committed a reproducer for the first.

SECTION 1-3 -- is `(bill, version, text_sha256)` a valid identity? (round 3)

SECTION 4 -- does the REPLACEMENT identifier actually hold? (round 4)
    Round 3 replaced the text hash with `(source_sha256, parser_commit, element_id)` and the schema
    cited "R9 §4" for `element_id` being unique and non-empty across all 106 documents. **That
    section did not exist.** The measurement was run ad hoc in a shell and never committed, then
    cited as though it were a reproducer -- the exact defect this review programme has now caught
    three times (paper.md's unreproducible Appendix A, round 1's un-probed all-five-version claim,
    and now its own). It is committed here, and section 4 also measures the alternative identifier
    so the choice between them rests on evidence rather than on which one was thought of first.

--- original round 3 docstring follows ---

R9: is `(bill, version, text_sha256)` a valid identity for one parsed node?

`eval_pass2.py` joins truth counterparts, candidates and system output on that triple. The
reasoning behind rejecting `match_path` was right -- the path is the unstable key this whole
program exists because of, so joining on it would break the evaluator exactly where matching is
hardest. But the replacement assumes normalized body text is unique within a document, and nobody
checked. If two provisions in one version share a body, the evaluator silently treats them as one
node, which corrupts candidate recall, ranking, collision-group construction and assignment
accuracy at once -- and corrupts them in the direction of looking better, because a miss against
node X scores as a hit whenever some unrelated node Y happens to share its text.

This measures it on the real corpus, and prints instances rather than a count (a count cannot tell
a defect from its absence).

WHY THIS IS THE EXPECTED RESULT, not a surprise: appropriations bills are built from repeated
boilerplate. "No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall remain available for
obligation beyond the current fiscal year unless expressly so provided herein" appears once per
division. The repo already tracks the sibling defect for match_path collisions
(`tests/test_corpus_properties.py::_KNOWN_DUPLICATE_COUNTS`, issue #1); nobody had asked the same
question of body text.
