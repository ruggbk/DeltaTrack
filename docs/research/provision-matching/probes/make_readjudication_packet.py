"""Build the BLIND re-adjudication packet for the Study 1 observations that no longer reproduce.

R2 found three of twelve labeled pairs whose stored text corresponds to no node the current parser
emits. R7 then established WHICH link moved: the source XML is byte-identical since it entered git,
and the parser as of the answer-key commit reproduces all three stored texts from today's bytes. So
the parser's representation changed, the legislation did not, and the human's SAME/DIFFERENT
judgment about the legislation was never invalidated -- it is the derived observation that no longer
exists. The unit the human ruled on is not the unit the pipeline now produces, so the question has
to be put again over the current unit.

This script prepares that question and stops. It does not answer it, and no automated signal is
allowed to answer it either.

WHAT IS HIDDEN, and why each one would corrupt the answer:

  containment / word-overlap scores   the measures under evaluation. A reviewer who sees 0.428
                                      is being told what the method wants.
  the current matcher's decision      same problem, one step downstream.
  the ORIGINAL label                  this is a RE-adjudication; showing the prior verdict makes
                                      agreement the path of least resistance and the exercise
                                      worthless.
  which method benefits               the packet never says a ruling favours text or structure.

HOW THE OLD SIDE IS CHOSEN, which is the subtle part. For two of the three, the stored old text is
gone, so *something* has to decide which current node to put in front of the reviewer. Choosing it
by best text similarity -- the obvious move, and what R2's diagnostic table does -- would let a
measure under evaluation pick the evidence its own re-validation rests on. So this packet does not
choose at all: it shows EVERY node the current parser emits at the label's structural path, in
document order, and asks the reviewer which of them (if any) is the counterpart. Structural path is
not one of the measures being evaluated, it is the locator the label itself already carried, and
showing all of its occupants is exhaustive within that bound.

Two files are written, deliberately separate:

  readjudication-packet.md      what the reviewer reads. Blind.
  readjudication-sealed.json    historical observation, historical scores, original label, and
                                current provenance. For AFTER the ruling, to record it against.

The separation is a convention, not a technical control -- both files are committed and readable.
The automated part is the leak scan: the packet is run through the same `blindness.mask_corpus` /
`leaks_in` guard the live labeling path uses (protocol §5), plus an explicit check that no stored
score string and no original label verdict appears in it.
