"""Generate a self-contained HTML labeling form per reviewer (no server, no install).

The reviewer opens `form_<name>.html` in any browser, labels one card at a time, and clicks
"Download my labels" to get `labels_<name>.json` to send back. State autosaves to the
browser's localStorage so they can close and resume. Nothing leaves their machine until they
export — fits the local-only constraint (ADR 0011).

Anti-priming (protocol §5): the card shows only the two texts + structural breadcrumbs + a
NEUTRALLY phrased question. It never shows the mining stratum name, the scores under test, or
the matcher's decision. Rationale is required whenever confidence is medium/low.

The HTML/CSS/JS lives in `form_template.html` (edit it there); this script only injects the
reviewer's assigned, blinded candidates as JSON.

Run (per reviewer; the reviewer must exist in assignments.json):
