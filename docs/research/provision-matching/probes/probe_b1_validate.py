"""B1 validation: does IDF-weighted containment separate same/different on the FULL
corpus, not just the 14 answer-key points? And what are ITS false-keeps?

Over all matched pairs (both sides, text differs) in the corpus we compute word_ratio,
tfidf_cosine, tfidf_contain. Then:

 1. In the raw-ratio DEAD ZONE (word_ratio in [0.35,0.65]) is containment bimodal?
 2. NEW SPLITS: word_ratio >= 0.40 (currently KEPT) but containment < 0.55.
    -> switching to containment would split these. Sample for genuine-different vs false.
 3. NEW KEEPS: word_ratio < 0.40 (currently SPLIT) but containment >= 0.55.
    -> switching would keep these. Sample for genuine-same vs false-keep (containment's
       risk: a short provision whose few weighted tokens coincidentally sit in a longer one).
 4. Report how many decisions change overall and the containment histogram.
