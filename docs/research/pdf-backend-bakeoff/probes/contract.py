"""The neutral `PdfPage` contract every backend in the bake-off emits.

This is the seam the spec's "isolate the backend, not the pipeline" section calls for.
Each backend's only job is to produce layout facts; nothing downstream of here knows
which library produced them. In particular, no backend is asked to reproduce PDFium's
text-API conventions (the U+FFFE soft hyphen, trailing spaces, the scrambled reading
order that floats running headers to the top), because `parsers/pdf_text.normalize_raw`
exists specifically to undo those, and asking a challenger to reproduce them would
reintroduce the incumbent as the reference.

A `Glyph` is deliberately the smallest tuple the engine's geometry consumers need:

    unicode     codepoint (int)
    x0,y0,x1,y1 bounding box in PDF page space (points, y up)
    baseline    y of the text-matrix origin -- the TRUE baseline, not the box bottom
    font_size   effective rendered size in points (font size x text-matrix scale)
    font_id     PostScript/base font name, "" when the backend cannot resolve one
    upright     True when the glyph sits on a horizontal baseline

`upright` earns its place because GPO pages carry a ROTATED left-gutter watermark. For
rotated text the matrix origin is not a horizontal baseline, so those glyphs must be
excluded from horizontal line clustering or they collide with body lines: measured on
this corpus, a stray rotated glyph landed on the baseline of printed lines 24 and 25 and
destroyed the margin-number match for both. PDFium happened to escape that because its
rotated glyphs share one text object; pdfminer and PyMuPDF give each its own origin.
Recovering the fact from box geometry alone is not reliable, and every candidate backend
exposes it directly (mat.b, LTChar.upright, span dir, item transform), so it is a fact
the contract should carry rather than a heuristic the layer should guess.

Backends emit JSONL so a Node adapter and a Python adapter are interchangeable: one
object per page, then a final {"summary": {...}} line.
