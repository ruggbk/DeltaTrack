"""Hybrid reconstruction: engine-ordered characters + geometry -> DeltaTrack `Page`.

Deliberately a minimal edit of `reconstruct.py`, so that a difference in results is
attributable to the one thing that changed. Identical here: the margin-number regex, the
chrome patterns, the chrome size ratio, the baseline tolerance, the geometry sidecar, the
merge, and the reuse of production's `_merge_print_lines` / `rejoin_soft_hyphens`.

THE ONE THING THAT CHANGED, and the whole hypothesis:

    reconstruct.py  sorts a line's glyphs by x and RE-DERIVES the word spaces from
                    x-gaps, using one global constant (`_SPACE_FACTOR`).
    this module     takes the line's characters in the engine's own order and uses the
                    word spaces the engine already decided, including the ones it
                    SYNTHESISED from font metrics.

Line assignment stays geometric (cluster on baseline), not stream-order, and that split
is the point of the design rather than a compromise. The two failure modes are different
and they live at different scales:

  * BETWEEN lines, PDFium's reading order is unreliable on GPO pages -- it floats the
    running header to the top of the page. Geometry fixes that, and `pdf_text.py`'s
    `strip_page_chrome` exists because the string pipeline cannot.
  * WITHIN a line, geometry is not sufficient -- see `probe_space_separability.py`: the
    gap/size ratio at real word boundaries overlaps the ratio inside words, so no single
    threshold separates them. The engine's decision is.

So each layer is used where it is actually the better source, rather than one being
declared authoritative for everything.

WHAT THIS LAYER DOES NOT NEED, and why that is a finding
--------------------------------------------------------
Against `reconstruct.py` it drops the x-gap word-space rule and the "unnamed ink,
line-final" hyphen heuristic. Against `parsers/pdf_text.py` it additionally drops
`normalize_raw` in full: the U+FFFE-plus-glued-margin-number rewrite, the glued-chrome
rewrite, the mid-line hyphen join and the trailing-space strip are all repairs of damage
that only exists in a page-wide text BLOB, and none of it exists once the characters are
addressed by index with their geometry attached.
