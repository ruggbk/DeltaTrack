"""Neutral reconstruction: `PdfPage` glyph facts -> the `Page`/`Line` structures DeltaTrack consumes.

This is the layer the spec calls for in "the seam must be glyph facts, not PDFium-shaped
text". Every backend is graded through this one implementation, so no backend can win by
imitating the incumbent's text-API conventions.

WHAT THIS LAYER DOES NOT NEED, and why that matters
---------------------------------------------------
`parsers/pdf_text.normalize_raw` has no counterpart here, and that is the point. Every
transformation it performs exists to undo damage PDFium's *text API* does:

  * the U+FFFE soft-hyphen glyph with the next margin number glued inline
  * footer chrome dragged onto a line by a page-boundary hyphen
  * trailing spaces PDFium keeps on nearly every line
  * a scrambled reading order that floats running headers to the top of the page

None of those exist in the glyph stream. At glyph level GPO renders an ordinary
hyphen-minus at a syllable break, chrome sits where it is printed, and reading order is
whatever we choose -- here, strictly top-to-bottom by baseline. So the neutral path is
SHORTER than the incumbent's, not longer, and it is a genuine finding of this spike that
~40% of `pdf_text.py`'s regex surface is backend-repair rather than domain logic.

WHAT IT REUSES
--------------
`_merge_print_lines`, `_parse_print_lines` and `rejoin_soft_hyphens` are imported from
production unchanged: they operate on already-assembled lines and carry no PDFium
assumption. `_line_text` and `_first_word_right` are reimplemented here only because the
production versions take a fixed 5-tuple; the logic (gap-based spacing, space-glyph word
boundary) is identical and is exercised against the incumbent by the calibration gate.

`_cluster_baselines` is deliberately NOT reused. It clusters on the char-box bottom with
a tolerance of 0.5x the page-median glyph size, which is correct for its own purpose (a
margin-number -> geometry sidecar, where a descender-only fragment simply fails the
line-number match and is dropped) but wrong for text reconstruction: on a 14pt body line
the descender drop is ~8.4pt against a 7pt tolerance, so `heading` splits into `headin`
plus a stray `g`. The contract carries the text-matrix origin instead, which every
candidate backend exposes and which is exact.
