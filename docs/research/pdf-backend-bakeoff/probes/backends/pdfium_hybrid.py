"""Backend adapter: PDFium's TEXT PAGE character stream, enriched with per-index geometry.

This is the layer under test. It is NOT a third way of reading glyphs; it is the same
`FPDFText_*` char index used twice -- once for the character PDFium decided belongs
there, once for that character's geometry -- rather than once for geometry only.

WHY THIS IS AVAILABLE AT ALL
----------------------------
PDFium's `CPDF_TextPage` builds one char list per page. `FPDFText_CountChars` counts it,
`FPDFText_GetUnicode(i)` names entry i, and `GetCharBox(i)` / `GetCharOrigin(i)` /
`GetMatrix(i)` / `GetFontSize(i)` / `GetFontInfo(i)` all address the SAME entry i. The
list already contains the characters PDFium synthesised rather than read -- word spaces
it derived from font metrics, and line breaks -- flagged by `FPDFText_IsGenerated(i)`.
Measured on this corpus: `FPDFText_CountChars(page) == len(get_text_range(page))` on
every page tried, and `FPDFText_GetTextIndexFromCharIndex` is the identity, so there is
no index skew to correct.

WHAT GENERATED CHARACTERS CARRY, MEASURED NOT ASSUMED
-----------------------------------------------------
A generated character has NO meaningful box, matrix, font size or font name: the box is
a zero-area point, the matrix is the identity (so `matrix.f`, the baseline the glyph
contract carries, reads 0.0), `GetFontSize x scale` reads exactly 1.0, and the font name
is empty. Exactly one geometric fact survives, and it is the one that matters:
`FPDFText_GetCharOrigin(i)` returns the correct baseline y.

So this adapter does not invent geometry for generated characters. It carries the origin
PDFium gives, marks the character as generated, and leaves the rest absent. Downstream,
generated characters are placed by their neighbours in the stream, never by their box.

THE ONE PLACE THE TEXT AND GLYPH APIS DISAGREE
-----------------------------------------------
`get_text_range()[i]` and `FPDFText_GetUnicode(i)` are the same string except at GPO's
soft hyphen, where the text API says U+FFFE and the glyph API says 0x02. Those indices
are exactly the ones `FPDFText_IsHyphen(i)` flags -- so the soft hyphen is recoverable
from a documented predicate rather than from either private convention, and rather than
from the bake-off's "unnamed ink, line-final" position heuristic. It is emitted here as
U+00AD (SOFT HYPHEN), a neutral name no backend owns.

Emits the enriched contract in `contract_hybrid.py`, in PDFium's own char order.
