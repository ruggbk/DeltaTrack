"""H6 — two things H4 asserted more strongly than it measured.

H4 reported max |Δ advance| = 0.0 pt over 390,582 endpoints and concluded the engines
"return the same advances". Both halves need narrowing.

  **A. The comparison ran on ROUNDED values.** Every adapter rounds `advance` to four
     decimal places on the way into `contract_extended`, so H4 established equality at the
     contract's 1e-4 pt precision. Whether the engines' raw returns are bit-identical was
     never tested, and it is a different claim. `raw_facts.py` re-reads the same glyphs at
     full precision and this probe compares those. **The expected answer is not assumed:**
     PDFium's glyph width arrives through a `c_float` (24-bit mantissa) and MuPDF's
     advance is computed in single precision too, so a small non-zero difference is a live
     possibility and would still leave the architectural result intact.

  **B. 4,579 of PDFium's 200,684 pairs (2.3 %) never joined**, and H4 reported the coverage
     without saying what was in the gap. If the unjoined population were concentrated on
     headings or on the display type that carries account names, the portability claim
     would not reach the places DeltaTrack most depends on. This probe classifies it.

NEGATIVE CONTROLS.

  N13  `raw_facts.check()` asserts the raw sidecar reproduces each adapter glyph for
       glyph. Without it this probe could compare a different population and report
       agreement.
  N14  the joined population is asserted to match H4's committed totals exactly. If the
       key set here differed, the "same population" claim in A would be false.
  N15  the raw comparison reports the EXACTLY-EQUAL count separately from the
       below-contract-precision count. Collapsing them is what produced the overstatement
       being corrected.
  N16  the unjoined diagnosis attempts a tolerance-based nearest-neighbour rematch. That is
       a diagnostic, not a repair: it exists to say whether the gap is a quantisation
       artefact of the join or a real difference between engines, and the rematched pairs
       are reported separately and never folded into H4's headline count.
