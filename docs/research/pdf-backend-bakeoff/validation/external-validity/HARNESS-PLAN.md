# Downstream harness — contract and dependency plan

**Status: PLAN ONLY. None of the five components is built.** Nothing here is frozen
protocol; it is a mapping of already-frozen rules onto executable contracts, submitted for
review before implementation. Where the frozen rules do not determine an outcome-affecting
choice, the ambiguity is surfaced in §7 rather than resolved.

Frozen inputs this plan assumes, all approved: A19 (neutral skeleton, 8-line regions,
withdrawn C-frame enrichment), A20 (M6 deferred, RQ2 narrowed), A21–A24 (`sci` vs `ngid`,
Model G, text vs segmentation discordance, M0 risk set), A25 (X2-b boundary counterfactual),
A5 + A10 (Rule 1 and the adjudication budget), **A27** (matching key, C-frame
reservation removed, region-based D-frame budget, Rule 0 outcomes, §8 owner, Rule 3 gate
vector, frozen determinism), and **A30** (the occurrence key's fourth component is the
absolute `start_ngid`; the oracle's occurrence position is geometric; P-head adequacy and
realized blind-ID uniqueness are executable).

**Every frozen methodology section has an owner** — §4.5 `decide_architecture` (**resolved by
A28.1/A28.2, executable since A30.4**); §5.3–5.4 `build_oracle`; §5.5.1 + §5.8 `build_frames` (frames) and
`decide_architecture` (budget); §5.6 `adjudicator_prompt` + `build_oracle`; §5.7
`build_oracle`; §6 `score_metrics`; §7 `decide_architecture`; §8 `score_metrics`.

## 1. Dependency order

```
        run_hybrid ──┐
                     ├──► build_frames ──► build_oracle ──► [HUMAN / AI adjudication]
        run_extended ┘         │                                      │

```

`adjudicator_prompt.md` is an input to `build_oracle`, not a stage. It must be committed
before any oracle artifact is produced, because it is part of what determines a label.

**Build order: `build_frames` → `adjudicator_prompt` → `build_oracle` → `score_metrics` →
`decide_architecture`.** Each stage's output is a committed JSON artifact, so a later stage
never re-derives an earlier stage's decisions.

---

## 2. `build_frames.py`

**Implements:** §5.8 (two frames, never pooled), A19 (neutral skeleton, 8-line regions,
enrichment withdrawn), A22/A23 (D-frame = union of text / segmentation / anchor discordance),
A23 (M0 comparative risk set).

| | |
|---|---|
| **inputs** | holdout PDF paths + `holdout_membership.json`; `run_hybrid.run`, `run_extended.run` |
| **outputs** | `results/frames.json`: per document → per page → neutral lines (`key`, `baseline`, bbox, `gids`), regions (8 consecutive neutral lines, page-bounded), per-neutral-line `line_state`, per-region C/D membership with the reason each entered |

**Permitted decisions:** JSON layout only. The C-frame draw is **not** a free choice: A27.7
fixes it as `rank by sha256("cframe-select|20260807|(doc_sha256,page,region_ordinal)")`,
first ≤ 8 per document.

**Must NOT decide:** which lines are neutral (that is `eligible` + `cluster`, frozen);
region size or alignment; any use of text to form a region; any enrichment predicate
(withdrawn by A19); **any amount-bearing reservation (REMOVED by A27.2)**; whether a
jointly-absent line enters the D-frame (it does not); the selection seed or ranking rule.

### Invariants

- **I1** C-frame regions are enumerated from the **neutral skeleton only**. Enumerating from
  emitted lines would make a jointly-dropped line unsamplable and a shared failure invisible.
- **I2** the skeleton is byte-identical under both arms (`x13` already asserts this).
- **I3** `BOTH_ABSENT` lines are in the region grid and in `frames.json`, are **excluded**
  from the M0 risk set, and **cannot alone** put a region in the D-frame.
- **I4** a D-frame region records the predicate(s) that caused **the region** to enter, and
  separately the specific neutral lines that were discordant. A non-discordant line inside a
  D-frame region must never be recorded as individually qualifying — the region is the
  membership unit, the line is the evidence.
- **I5** regions never cross pages.

### Controls

| control | what fact makes it fail |
|---|---|
| skeleton identity H vs X | any page where the two runners' `(key, gids)` lists differ |
| region partition is total | a neutral line belonging to zero or ≥2 regions |
| synthetic jointly-dropped body line | it fails to appear in any C-frame-eligible region |
| synthetic chrome-only page | any of its lines enters the D-frame |
| **negative:** injected merge/split on one arm | that region does **not** enter the D-frame |
| **negative:** injected text change on one arm | that region does **not** enter the D-frame |
| **negative:** anchor set differs, text identical | that region does **not** enter the D-frame |
| **negative:** a concordant line inside a D-frame region | it is recorded as individually qualifying (I4) |
| determinism | the same commit + inputs select a different C-frame set or order |

---

## 3. `adjudicator_prompt.md`

**Implements:** §5.4 (the adjudicator sees only the region), §5.5.1 (human for D-frame),
§5.6 (negative controls indistinguishable), A20 (RQ2 narrowed).

**Must contain:** the task, the region image, and nothing else identifying an architecture.
**Must NOT contain:** any H or X text, any architecture name, any hint that a region is a
control, or any question about amount→account attribution (M6 is deferred; asking would
collect data the study may not use and could bias heading answers).

**Asked for:** heading occurrences present, their exact printed text, their immediate parent,
a coarse leaf/container role, and — per **A30.3** — **enough source position to name the
occurrence key**: `start_physical_line`, and `start_x_px`, the integer horizontal coordinate
of the **left edge of the first printed character** of that occurrence in the rendered
stimulus. Nothing else.

`start_x_px` is an **identity annotation only** — text, role and parent stay independently
adjudicated. It replaces A27.1's "order on that line", which could not be derived: an ordinal
renumbers a later occurrence whenever an earlier one on the same line is missing, and
production emits a `section` and an inline `subsection` at the same `(page, line)`. The R1
repeat records its **own** `start_x_px` and is resolved independently.

| control | what fact makes it fail |
|---|---|
| prompt contains no architecture output | a grep for H/X text or arm names hits |
| N-A altered-PDF region | the adjudicator transcribes the unaltered text, i.e. cannot see the failure class → M2/M3 void |
| N-C heading-free region | a heading is reported → precision claims void |
| R1 repeat at a different scale | heading-text agreement < 0.90 → text metrics void |

---

## 4. `build_oracle.py`

**Implements:** §5.4, §5.7 (provenance), §5.6 (controls shuffled in), A19 (regions are
neutral), A24.2 (region bbox comes from the skeleton, which now excludes U+0020).

| | |
|---|---|
| **inputs** | `frames.json`; the PDFs; `adjudicator_prompt.md` |
| **outputs** | two artifacts with deliberately different contents, below |

**`results/oracle_key.json`** — committed **before** adjudication, then **not opened by the
adjudicator**:

```
opaque blind id ->
    canonical stimulus identity        (A28.3, pre-blinding)
    document_sha256
    page_number
    region_ordinal
    stratum
    frame                              C | D
    control / repeat bookkeeping       control_kind, control_variant, r1 base identity
    every H/X architecture output needed for the later join
    renderer name + version, DPI, bbox in PDF points, PNG sha256
```

**The adjudicator-facing blind artifact** carries **only** what the frozen blinding protocol
permits: the **opaque id**, the **rendered image**, and the **question / codebook**. It must
never carry architecture output, frame, stratum, document identity, or control status.

**Permitted decisions: NONE that affect an outcome.** Render scale is frozen by A28.4 —
**300 DPI** primary, **330 DPI** for the R1 repeat, same bbox and source region, raster scale
the only difference. Selection and ordering are frozen by A27.7 as amended by A28.3: the
`cframe-audit` and `r1-repeat` draws rank canonical **base** stimulus identities and
`blind-order` ranks canonical **final instance** identities. **No ranking may consume a blind
id.** The blind id is derived only after selection is settled and is an adjudicator-facing
alias only.

**Must NOT:** render from any architecture's text; let a region's H/X content influence
cropping; reveal control status; write the key after adjudication has begun.

### Invariants

- **I6** the renderer reads **PDF geometry only**. No arm's text reaches it.
- **I7** every stimulus carries its PNG sha256, so a later re-render is *detected*.
- **I8** `oracle_key.json` is committed strictly before `oracle_adjudicated.json` exists
  (F6 already checks this ordering by git).
- **I14** (A30.5) **blind ids are unique over the COMPLETE REALIZED stimulus set**, asserted
  before any oracle artifact is committed and before adjudication begins. A collision is a
  deterministic **build failure requiring review** — never an overwrite, a merge, a
  last-write-wins, or an automatic salt/re-roll. Salting after seeing the stimulus set would
  let the set choose the alias scheme, the influence A28.3 removed.
- **I15** (A30.3) the adjudicated `start_x_px` is converted to page PDF coordinates from the
  **committed region bbox, the rendered image width and the frozen DPI only**, then resolved
  to the nearest neutral ink glyph on the reported physical line — **no tolerance**, and an
  exact tie or an absent candidate yields `UNMATCHED`. The skeleton supplies **identity
  only**, never heading truth.

| control | what fact makes it fail |
|---|---|
| re-render determinism | same region renders to a different PNG hash |
| scale | a primary is not 300 DPI, or an R1 repeat is not 330 DPI, or the repeat's bbox differs from its primary, or either is rescaled afterwards |
| **negative:** blind-id scheme swapped | any selected item or presentation rank changes (A28.3) |
| **negative:** blind artifact leakage | a grep of the adjudicator file finds frame, stratum, document id, control status or arm text |
| bbox ↔ skeleton agreement | a rendered crop omits a neutral line the region claims |
| **negative:** shuffle the key | adjudications still align to the right regions (would prove the key is not load-bearing, i.e. the join is fake) |
| **negative:** injected blind-ID collision | the build completes instead of aborting (I14) |
| **negative:** exact geometric tie for `start_x_px` | a glyph is chosen instead of `UNMATCHED` (I15) |
| R1 start identity | a repeat reuses the primary's coordinate or resolved identity rather than resolving its own |

---

## 5. `score_metrics.py`

**Implements:** §6 (M0–M9 minus M6), A19 (denominators), A20 (RQ2 narrowed), A22/A23 (M0
components, risk set, D-frame), A3/A4 + `m3_boundaries` (M3), §5.8 cross-engine control,
A24.2 reporting.

| | |
|---|---|
| **inputs** | `frames.json`, `oracle_adjudicated.json`, `oracle_key.json`, `x09` cross-engine result |
| **also owns** | the **§8 statistical contract** (A27.5) |
| **outputs** | `results/metrics.json`: M0a/M0b/M0-any/M0c + raw components, M1–M5, M7, M9, per-document and pooled, each with its content-bearing denominator and any `PDFIUM-CONDITIONED FRAME` label |

### The M0 block, exactly

```
risk set      neutral lines with state != BOTH_ABSENT
M0a           |TEXT_DISCORDANCE|            / |risk set|
M0b           |SEGMENTATION_DISCORDANCE|    / |risk set|
M0-any        union, never a sum            / |risk set|
M0b_defined   lines where SEGMENTATION_DEFINED (C(N) non-empty)
M0b_rate_on_defined  |SEGMENTATION_DISCORDANCE| / |M0b_defined|
M0c           |regions with ANCHOR_DISCORDANCE| / |regions|   -- never pooled with the above
both_absent   raw count, reported, never in a denominator
```

**Reporting rule carried forward from the A23 review:** `M0b_segmentation_rate` is over the
full risk set; only `M0b_rate_on_defined` may be described as "the fraction of comparable
groupings that disagree". `score_metrics` must emit both and must not emit a single "M0b".

### The §8 block (A27.5)

```
event          per DOCUMENT: "has >= 1 heading-level H/X discordance"
estimand       pi = P(a document from the target population shows that event)
bound          exact one-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson upper bound on pi, unit = DOCUMENT
zero events    closed form 1 - 0.05**(1/N); NO bootstrap (degenerate, measured in 8.1)
non-zero       bootstrap permitted, reported alongside
paired         per-document paired differences; UNWEIGHTED mean over documents;
               per-document detail is mandatory, never collapsed to one number
forbidden      any per-heading probability, any heading-as-iid-trial denominator
```

**Must NOT decide:** to pool M0c with the line rates; to weight the components into a
composite; to drop `both_absent` from the report; to let M3 read a segmentation label
(M3 consumes **projected text + oracle** only).

### Invariants

- **I9** every M0a/M0b discordant line's region is in the D-frame (same predicates decide
  both — no divergent eligibility sets).
- **I10** M1 recall's denominator is the **adjudicated** enumeration, never the emitted one.
- **I11** a metric whose content-bearing denominator is zero is reported `VACUOUS`, never as
  agreement.
- **I12** M9 is computed per document per architecture and can reject an arm outright (§7.2
  rule 0) before any other metric is consulted.
- **I13** cross-engine: a document below **0.95** (or any sampled page below **0.75**) labels
  **every RQ1 and RQ2 result computed on it** `PDFIUM-CONDITIONED FRAME`; failure on **more
  than ⅓** of sampled documents applies the qualification to **both** headlines. Never blocks.

| control | what fact makes it fail |
|---|---|
| S1 liveness (advances × 1.25) | M0 does **not** rise → the comparator is not live and M0 is not reportable |
| M3 weld/space fixture | `FAMILYHOUSING` vs `FAMILY HOUSING` does not reach M3 as `X_CORRECTS` |
| M3 insulation | a split-only difference fabricates a weld/split against a clean oracle |
| **negative:** delete agency anchors | M4 does **not** fall further than M1 |
| **negative:** shift heading baselines one line-height | M4 does **not** fall |
| **negative:** inject an `R E P O R T` page | M7 does **not** detect it |
| M0 denominator | a `BOTH_ABSENT` line appears in any M0 denominator |
| vacuity | a zero-denominator metric is printed as a rate |
| **§8 independence** | the bound computed on `N` documents equals the bound computed on `H` headings when `H != N` — i.e. headings were treated as iid trials. §8.1's own 0.1926 vs 0.00498 (39×) is the fixture |
| **§8 zero-event** | a bootstrap is reported at zero events, or the closed form is not `1 - 0.05**(1/N)` |
| **§8 pairing** | the paired mean is weighted by heading count instead of unweighted over documents |

---

## 6. `decide_architecture.py`

**Implements:** §7.2 rule 0 (M9), A5 rule 1 as amended by A20, A10 (budget), §7.2 rule 3.

**Rule 1 after A20 — choose X only if ALL hold, on a FULL census:**

```
1. X_CORRECTS   >= 5      heading occurrences
2. X_REGRESSES  == 0      heading occurrences
3. no heading whose immediate parent is correct under H and wrong under X   (M4)
   [the M6 condition is STRUCK by A20]
```

**Budget, per A10 as unit-fixed by A27.3:** the adjudication item is a **REGION**. Enumerate
the complete D-frame region census first. **≤ 60 regions** → adjudicate the full census and
Rule 1 may be evaluated. **> 60 regions** → Rule 1 cannot choose X; the outcome is
`INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE`, and a 60-region sample is descriptive only. §5.8's
120-region clause is superseded; **Rule 1 never runs on a 60- or 120-region sample.**

**Rule 0 (M9) runs FIRST and has its own outcomes (A27.4):** `EXTENDED_BY_RULE_0_M9` when H
has an asymmetric M9 loss and X none; `HYBRID_BY_RULE_0_M9` for the mirror; and when **each**
arm has an asymmetric loss on different documents, **both are rejected** —
`INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE`, with no invented comparison by count or severity.

**Rule 3 gate vector (A27.6), each an explicit inspectable status:** R1, N-A, N-B, N-C, S1,
confirmatory X2-a, confirmatory X2-b, M9 evaluability, §4.5 adequacy. Any failure →
`INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE`. x09 is a **reporting qualification only**.

**Three outcomes, never collapsed:**

| outcome | meaning |
|---|---|
| `EXTENDED_BY_RULE_0_M9` | H lost a document's heading tree, X did not |
| `HYBRID_BY_RULE_0_M9` | X lost a document's heading tree, H did not |
| `EXTENDED_BY_RULE_1` | X met every condition on a full census |
| `HYBRID_BY_PRIOR` | the pre-stated architectural prior stands; comparative evidence did not overturn it |
| `INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE` | Rule 1 could not be evaluated — census over budget, or a control failed |

**Must NOT:** write "H is more accurate" on an X failure. H survives **by prior**, only while
the study is valid and X fails its win conditions. The decider must emit the outcome enum and
a pre-committed sentence, and must refuse to emit any comparative-accuracy claim about H.

| control | what fact makes it fail |
|---|---|
| synthetic X win (6 corrects, 0 regressions, no M4 regression) | outcome is not `EXTENDED_BY_RULE_1` |
| synthetic 5 corrects **and 1 regression** | outcome is `EXTENDED_BY_RULE_1` (must be insufficient) |
| synthetic 5 corrects **and 1 M4 regression** | outcome is `EXTENDED_BY_RULE_1` |
| synthetic census of **61 regions** | outcome is anything other than `INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE` |
| synthetic asymmetric M9 loss for H only | outcome is not `EXTENDED_BY_RULE_0_M9` |
| synthetic asymmetric M9 loss on BOTH arms, different documents | outcome is not `INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE` (a severity comparison was invented) |
| any Rule 3 gate set to FAIL | outcome is not `INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE` |
| x09 set to FAIL | the outcome changes at all (it must only add a label) |
| synthetic empty census | outcome is not `HYBRID_BY_PRIOR`, or the text claims H won empirically |
| **wording gate** | the rendered conclusion contains an empirical-superiority claim for H |
| M9 one-arm loss | the losing arm is not rejected outright before other metrics |

---

## 7. Ambiguity register

### RULED by A27 — no longer open

| was | ruling |
|---|---|
| 7.1 M1–M4 matching key | **A27.1** — source-position key; no text similarity, no order-within-region; unmappable → `UNMATCHED`. **Its fourth component is SUPERSEDED by A30.1** — see below |
| 7.2 40 % amount reservation | **A27.2** — REMOVED; plain uniform C-frame, ≤ 8 regions/document |
| 7.3 60 items vs 120 regions | **A27.3** — the item is a **region**; full census enumerated first; ≤ 60 → adjudicate all, Rule 1 evaluable; > 60 → `INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE`, sample descriptive only |

### RESOLVED by measurement — 7.4 anchor→neutral bridge

**Proven, not argued** (`x14_anchor_bridge.py`, `results/x14_anchor_bridge.json`):

```
Anchor(page_number, line_number)   <- line_number is the GPO PRINTED margin number
  -> the unique index i in Page.print_lines carrying that margin number
  -> run_hybrid.emitted_lines(...)[i]    same index, equality re-asserted locally
  -> EmittedLine.cells -> ngid           neutral ink identity (A24.2)
  -> owning NeutralLine -> region ordinal
```

The bridge is **BILATERAL** (A28.5): the *same* refusing rule runs on both arms over the same
material, and both are asserted to bridge onto the *same* neutral skeleton.

| document | H placed / anchors | X placed / anchors | unplaceable |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `114-hr-2029/4` | **11 / 11** | **11 / 11** | none |
| `118-s-4795/1` | **16 / 16** | **16 / 16** | none |

No heading text is consulted at any step. Four negative controls prove the bridge **refuses
rather than guesses**: a margin number appearing twice on a page → `AMBIGUOUS_MARGIN_NUMBER_ON_PAGE`;
a margin number on no print line → `NO_PRINT_LINE_WITH_THAT_MARGIN_NUMBER`; an emitted line
carrying no neutral ink → `EMITTED_LINE_CARRIES_NO_NEUTRAL_INK`; and a clean anchor places.

**No further instrumentation is required for `build_frames`.** `run_hybrid.run()` already
exposes `page` additively (A28.5), and `run_extended.run()` returns the same key, so each arm
hands back its own production `Page` objects carrying `print_lines` and `merge_ranges`.
`build_frames` derives each arm's production anchors by calling `extract_anchors` on those
returned `Page` objects — **exactly as `x14` does** — so no `anchors` key is added to the
runner dict and no arm has a private path. The earlier proposal to add one is **withdrawn as
unnecessary**, not deferred.

**Anti-drift gate, still binding:** the index-for-index `print_lines` ↔ `emitted` assertion
must run over **every page the harness consumes**, not one example. `x14` and `x17` both
enforce it.

### RULED by A28 — §4.5 and the last two determinism holes

| was | ruling |
|---|---|
| §4.5 Gap A, whose occurrence count | **A28.1** — `|H_keys ∪ X_keys|` over A27.1 source-position keys; P-head only; `account`/`agency`/`grouping` only; both-arms counts once; no text, no oracle |
| §4.5 Gap B, non-exhaustive/overlapping rows | **A28.2** — ordered exhaustive state machine, thresholds unchanged; `LIMITED` does **not** fail Rule 3 |
| blind ids could steer sampling | **A28.3** — canonical pre-blinding identities are ranked; the blind id is a post-selection alias only |
| render DPI was an implementation choice | **A28.4** — 300 DPI primary, 330 DPI R1 repeat, same bbox |

### RULED by A30 — the occurrence identity, proven derivable

| was | ruling |
|---|---|
| A27.1's `occurrence_ordinal_on_that_line` was never derived | **A30.1** — the fourth component is the absolute **`start_ngid`**, the A24.2 ink identity of the occurrence's first neutral-ink character. Used for **equality only**; nothing orders occurrences by it |
| could production supply it? | **A30.2** — yes. `Anchor` → merged-line start offset → `Page.merge_ranges` → print line + offset → `emitted[...].cells` → first cell carrying an `ngid`. Instrumented **study-locally**; production recognition unchanged; nine explicit refusal classes, all → `UNMATCHED` |
| how does the oracle name the same occurrence? | **A30.3** — geometrically: `start_physical_line` + `start_x_px`, converted from the committed bbox / image width / frozen DPI, resolved to the nearest neutral ink glyph with **no tolerance**; tie or no candidate → `UNMATCHED` |
| §4.5 P-head was a caller obligation | **A30.4** — `filter_keys` now takes `(key, kind, population)` and applies both restrictions itself |
| blind-ID uniqueness was only synthetic | **A30.5** — asserted over the **realized** set; a collision aborts the build |

**Proven, not argued** (`x16_occurrence_identity.py`, `results/x16_occurrence_identity.json`):

```
instrumented mirror == production extract_anchors    every DEVELOPMENT page consumed
same-line collisions                                 7 lines, ALL section+subsection, H == X
cross-arm occurrence identity                        1249 shared, 1249 agree, 0 disagree
   of which the arms' TEXT disagreed                 30, identity agreed on all 30
refusals on development material                     none
key_H(B) == key_X(B) with A missing                  holds, and holds in the mirror
the REJECTED arm-local ordinal                       renumbers B 1 -> 0, so the control can fail
```

The `start_ngid` residue is stated rather than rounded off: ngid order agrees with printed
order on **33,592 of 33,602** emitted lines, the exceptions being single adjacent
transpositions in PDFium's text-page order. This is why A30.1 forbids *ordering* by `ngid`
and uses it for equality only; on the collisions themselves, ngid order matched printed
order **14/14**.

### Sweep for remaining delegated choices

§§4.5, 5.3–5.8, 6, 7 and 8 re-read for any surviving "permitted" or "seeded" phrase that
hands an outcome-affecting choice to future implementation. **Three hits, none open:**
`build_frames` permits "JSON layout only"; `build_oracle` permits "NONE that affect an
outcome"; §8's "bootstrap permitted" is the frozen rule itself (allowed only at non-zero
events). No further edge cases are manufactured.

> **Unresolved outcome-affecting ambiguities: ZERO.**

### 7.2 `X_CORRECTS` unit — *implementation-only, closed*

A3 fixes the M3 decision unit as the heading occurrence and Rule 1 counts heading
occurrences; they agree. `decide_architecture` counts `heading_outcome` results and never
boundary-level WELD/SPLIT tallies, which would inflate both counters. Recorded as a build
check, not an ambiguity.

---

## 8. Recommended implementation slice

With the register empty, the first slice is:

> **`build_frames.py` alone, DEVELOPMENT material only, with invariants I1–I5 and its nine
> controls.**

It consumes only frozen, tested inputs (`run_hybrid` — now additively exposing `page` —
`run_extended`, `neutral_identity`, `methodology_contracts`), produces the artifact every
later stage reads, and every one of its controls is constructible synthetically with no
oracle, no adjudication and no holdout document. Its determinism control is already
executable via `methodology_contracts.select`.

Nothing downstream of it may start until `build_frames` and its controls are reviewed.
