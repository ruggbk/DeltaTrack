"""x27 -- HARNESS-PLAN section 5's control table, executed against `score_metrics`.

NOT CONFIRMATORY. SYNTHETIC + DEVELOPMENT only. No holdout document is opened, nothing is
adjudicated by a human or an AI, no architecture decision is taken, and none of
`results/frames.json`, `oracle_key.json`, `oracle_blind.json`, `oracle_adjudicated.json`,
`s1_control.json`, `cross_engine_control.json`, `metrics.json`, `scores.json` or
`EXECUTION-START.json` is created. Evidence: `results/x27_score_metrics.json`.

RUN WITH AN INTERPRETER CARRYING BOTH `pymupdf` AND `pypdfium2`, as `x21`/`x22` require.

WHAT THIS PROBE EXISTS TO PROVE, and what would make each half FALSE:

    the scorer computes section 6 / section 8 from committed facts     -- every control below
    each frozen quantity can go RED                                   -- the negatives
    a malformed or incomplete input REFUSES rather than scoring        -- part_refusals
    the scorer never reads a summary it could have trusted             -- the corrupted-`counts`
                                                                         attack
    the same inputs give the same numbers                             -- part_reproducibility

THE SYNTHETIC ADJUDICATIONS ARE A MECHANISM FIXTURE, NEVER AN ACCURACY MEASUREMENT. Their
"oracle" text is taken from one arm's own emitted output, so agreement proves the JOIN works and
says nothing about whether either architecture is correct. Real adjudication is human/AI, does
not exist, and cannot exist before the execution boundary. Every number this probe prints is a
property of a fixture built here.
