"""x08 -- test the literal source-glyph identity contract. DESIGN MATERIAL.

NOT CONFIRMATORY. Synthetic fixtures plus DEVELOPMENT documents (hybrid only). No holdout
document is opened.

Part 1  the old projection defect, demonstrated then shown repaired
Part 2  cardinality: 1->1, 1->many, many->1, 50/50, reversed order, duplicate, unowned
Part 3  Model P (plurality) vs Model G (source-glyph partition)
Part 4  spacing preservation under partition
Part 5  D-frame symmetry under H/X swap, and NON-VACUOUSLY so
Part 6  eligibility is geometric, measured on DEVELOPMENT documents
Part 7  identity diagnostics carrying H reconstruction on DEVELOPMENT documents

The discordance semantics themselves (reconstruction signature, the three predicates, M0's
components) are exercised in `x10_reconstruction_signature.py`; this file keeps the
identity/projection evidence A21 rests on.
