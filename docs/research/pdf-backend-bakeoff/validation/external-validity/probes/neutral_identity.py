"""Neutral identity contract: literal source-glyph membership, and the discordance rules.

SUPERSEDES the projection half of `neutral_geometry.py`. A19 claimed projection was "by
GLYPH MEMBERSHIP" and that membership "needs no tolerance". Neither was true of the code:
`project_by_glyphs` received only BASELINES and assigned each to the nearest neutral line
with NO maximum distance, so a glyph at y = -5000 was still forced onto a neutral line.
That is baseline inference, not membership. This module makes the word literal.

THE NEUTRAL GLYPH ID
--------------------
    gid = (document_sha256, page_number, source_char_index)

`source_char_index` is the index `i` in `FPDFText_CountChars(text_page)` order -- the
engine's own text-page character index, which both adapters already iterate
(`for i in range(max(n, 0))`) and which **neither currently stores**: both `continue` past
characters they reject, so a list position is not the index. Recording `i` is pure
provenance: it changes no extraction decision on either arm, and it is the only exact
identity both arms can name for the same mark on the page.

ELIGIBILITY IS GEOMETRIC, NOT LEXICAL
-------------------------------------
A source glyph is neutral-eligible iff it has a VALID INK BOX -- present, finite, and
positive area -- and is upright. Newlines, generated spaces and control entries carry no
ink and are excluded by that rule alone. `x08` demonstrates this on development documents
rather than assuming it.

IDENTITY NORMALISATION IS NOT ARCHITECTURE-OUTPUT NORMALISATION
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is the distinction A22 exists to freeze, and the one the first cut of this module
erased. Model G answers *which physical line each source glyph belongs to*. That question
has one right answer and both arms must be held to it. It must NOT be allowed to answer
the different question of *how many lines the architecture emitted, and which glyphs it
grouped together* -- because that grouping IS an architecture output, and it is one of the
two things the seam can change.

Concretely: H welding two physical lines into one emitted line, while X emits two, leaves
both arms' PROJECTED TEXT identical on both neutral lines -- partition hands each line back
exactly its own glyphs. Comparing only projected text therefore reports `SAME` for a
reconstruction disagreement that A17.4 existed to observe. The repair is not to weaken the
projection; it is to compare a second, independent quantity: the RECONSTRUCTION SIGNATURE.

    TEXT_DISCORDANCE          what characters the arm produced for this line's glyphs
    SEGMENTATION_DISCORDANCE  how the arm grouped this line's glyphs into emitted lines

The two are deliberately orthogonal. A word-space difference (`FAMILYHOUSING` vs
`FAMILY HOUSING`) moves the text and must NOT move the signature -- inserted characters
carry no gid and never enter it. A merge or split moves the signature and need not move
the text. Keeping them separate is what lets M3 score word boundaries without a
segmentation difference fabricating a boundary error.

    identifies a physical ink mark. It does not: PDFium reports a box for a content-stream
    U+0020 about 3.6 pt wide and 0.014 pt tall, against 7.9 pt for a capital, so "positive

    narrows:

      * U+0020 is a BELOW-SEAM SOURCE FACT, available before either architecture runs;
      * X-2 already froze the architectural judgment that a space "carries no ink" -- this
        rule adopts a decision the protocol had already made, it does not invent one;
      * it reads no H or X output, so it cannot favour either arm;
      * `x12` measured that PDFium's char-box API simply does not encode the ink/non-ink
        distinction by area, so geometry alone cannot express the intended rule.

    NOT A WHITESPACE BLACKLIST. Only U+0020 is excluded, and only because X-2 froze it and
    x12 measured it. Newlines, generated spaces and control entries are still excluded by
    geometry alone. If another non-ink category appears, it is reported, not quietly added.

    Spacing is PRESERVED, which is the whole point: a NON-NEUTRAL character (`ngid is None`)
    is kept when it sits BETWEEN two retained ink glyphs of this line. So the same ink set
    yields "FAMILYHOUSING" from an architecture that welded and "FAMILY HOUSING" from one
    that did not -- the neutral skeleton supplies identity and never supplies spacing.

    THE ATTACHMENT RULE, frozen by A24.2 and unchanged in substance by it:

        a non-neutral character contributes to neutral line N iff, in the architecture's own
        emitted order, it lies BETWEEN two ink glyphs that N owns, with no ink glyph of
        another neutral line intervening.

    A24.2 makes this rule carry more traffic than before -- a content-stream space now has
    `ngid is None` like an inserted one -- and it needed no change to do so, which is the
    point: the rule was already about ATTACHMENT, not about identity. Its consequences,
    each tested rather than argued:

      * leading and trailing spaces are dropped (nothing owned precedes / follows them);
      * a space between ink of two DIFFERENT neutral lines is dropped from both, since a
        foreign ink glyph clears the pending buffer. It belongs to neither exclusively and
        no tie-break is invented;
      * consecutive spaces are kept or dropped together;
      * a content-stream space, a generated space and an X-inserted space are treated
        identically here, because at this point they differ only in provenance -- which is
        recorded on the cell and never consulted for attachment.

    Emitted lines are concatenated in the order of their FIRST owned gid, so ordering is a
    function of source identity rather than of emission order: reversing the list cannot
    change the result.

    THEY ARE JOINED BY "\\n", NOT BY "". This corrects A21, which joined by "" and thereby
    manufactured a WELD out of a SPLIT. When an arm emits one neutral line as two printed
    lines, its output really does carry a line break between those characters -- production
    joins printed lines with "\\n" (`Page.text`) -- so "" asserts an adjacency the arm never
    produced. The consequence was not cosmetic: a heading split at a word boundary would
    have projected as `FAMILYHOUSING`, scored a fabricated M3 weld against an oracle reading
    `FAMILY HOUSING`, and counted as `X_REGRESSES` -- a veto term in Rule 1.

    "\\n" needs no new machinery downstream: `m3_boundaries.decompose` tests `ch.isspace()`,
    so a line break is already read as a word boundary, and M2's frozen normalisation
    already collapses whitespace runs. A split at a word boundary therefore costs nothing,
    while a split MID-word still registers as a real boundary defect, which is correct --
    the arm did break the word across two printed lines.

    `common` is the page-wide set of gids BOTH arms emitted. Restricting to it is what
    separates grouping from coverage, and it is the whole of this repair.

    WHY THE RESTRICTION IS NECESSARY. Without it the signature reads the exact emitted gid
    subset, so PURE CHARACTER LOSS moves it: H emitting {0,1,2} as one line and X emitting
    {0,2} as one line gave `((0,1,2),())` vs `((0,2),())` -- unequal -- and reported a
    SEGMENTATION difference where both arms produced ONE line with identical grouping
    topology and X had simply dropped a glyph. Coverage was masquerading as topology.

    WHY IT MUST ALSO GOVERN `others`. Suppose H emits one line carrying N1's glyphs plus a
    glyph of N2 that X never emits. Reading `others` over ALL gids would name N2 for H and
    nothing for X, manufacturing a cross-line merge out of a coverage difference. Reading
    it over `common` cannot: a glyph only one arm emitted is not evidence about how the two
    arms GROUP anything, and it is already visible as loss and as a text difference.

    WHY TOPOLOGY STILL SURVIVES A COVERAGE DEFECT. The restriction removes gids, never
    grouping. If H merges N0+N1 while ALSO losing a glyph of N1, the surviving jointly
    observed glyphs of N1 are still carried by an emitted line that also carries N0's, so
    `others` still names N0 for H and not for X. Merge detection is untouched -- tested.

    Deliberately absent, each for a reason:

      * text and inserted characters -- a word-space difference must not register as a
        segmentation difference, or M3 would see a boundary error that does not exist;
      * REPEATED gids -- `EmittedLine.gids` is a set, so duplication cannot move the
        signature. (Measured: it never did. Duplication was already classified correctly
        before this repair, and only loss was mis-classified.);
      * emitted-line ids -- two arms numbering their lines differently is not a disagreement
        about grouping, and including lids would make every comparison trivially unequal;
      * glyphs off the neutral skeleton -- a coverage fact, counted separately.

    VACUOUS CASE, stated rather than hidden. When no gid of this line is jointly observed --
    one arm emitted nothing for it -- the signature is `()` for both arms and segmentation is
    concordant. That is correct: with no shared evidence there is no grouping to disagree
    about. The case is carried in full by text/coverage discordance, so it never leaves the
    D-frame; only its ATTRIBUTION between the two components changes.

    neutral line owning the first gid of the emitted line the anchor was read from decides
    its region. Sets, so ordering cannot create a spurious difference.

    DENOMINATOR: the comparative risk set -- neutral lines emitted by at least one arm.

    WHY BOTH_ABSENT IS OUT. PRE-REGISTRATION 6 defines M0 as the fraction of aligned
    printed lines "whose text differs BETWEEN H AND X". A line neither arm emitted is not a
    comparative observation on which they agreed; it is a unit not at risk. Counting it as
    an agreement makes the reported rate depend on how much page furniture a document
    carries -- running heads, page numbers, VerDate stamps -- which is a property of GPO's
    LAYOUT, not of the seam. That is a nuisance variable in the denominator, and it is worse
    than dilution: committee reports and bills carry different chrome densities, so a
    P-head/P-robust difference in M0 could be pure furniture.

    The question "discordance per physical ink line on the page" is a real question, but it
    is an ABSOLUTE coverage question -- did the arms emit the page's content at all -- and
    that is RQ2's, answered by the C-frame against an adjudicated oracle. M0 is RQ1's
    comparative resolution statement and may not silently answer a different one.

    NOTE THE DIRECTION, so the choice cannot be read as chosen for the number: removing
    BOTH_ABSENT SHRINKS the denominator and therefore RAISES every reported discordance
    rate. On development material the shift is about +7 % relative. RQ1 seeks an equivalence
    statement, so this change makes the study's own claim HARDER to support, not easier.

    `both_absent` is preserved as a raw count and is NOT discarded -- see `in_risk_set`.

    `M0b_only` is the number the segmentation repair exists to produce: neutral lines where
    the arms agree on every character but disagree on how they cut the page into lines.

    `M0b_defined` / `M0b_rate_on_defined` are reported beside the headline because
    segmentation is only DEFINED where the arms share evidence about a line. A zero M0b on
    the risk set must never be readable as "the arms grouped identically" when it could mean
    "one arm emitted nothing to group".
