"""x02 -- DESIGN MATERIAL. Is the XML reference actually disqualified as a heading oracle?

NOT CONFIRMATORY. Runs on the DEVELOPMENT corpus only.

Phases 1-3 all list "a valid heading-level oracle" as blocking, and all three give the
same reason: the XML reference comes from a parser known to drop `<quoted-block>`
(DeltaTrack#11), so a heading GPO printed can be absent from the reference and a PDF path
that finds it is scored wrong for being right.

That reason is inherited rather than measured, and a pre-registration may not build on an
inherited reason. Two things are checked here:

  1. DeltaTrack#11's state. It is CLOSED (2026-06-26, COMPLETED): a section's
     quoted-block TEXT now reaches the section body.
  2. What the structure tree still drops, and whether it is the class that matters.
     `bill_tree._node_subsections` keeps quoted-block subsections OUT of the tree by
     design -- "amendment payload ... not this bill's structure". So the question is not
     whether quoted-block content is dropped (some is, deliberately) but whether any
     APPROPRIATIONS heading is among it.

The distinction is the whole point. If appropriations headings live inside quoted blocks,
the XML cannot referee the metric the study cares about. If they never do, the XML is
disqualified for OTHER reasons -- which the pre-registration must then state honestly
instead of citing this one.
