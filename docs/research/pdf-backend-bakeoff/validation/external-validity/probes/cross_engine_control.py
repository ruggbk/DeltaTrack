"""cross_engine_control -- A39.2: the CONFIRMATORY cross-engine qualification producer.

    frozen rule   PRE-REGISTRATION red-team #2 / A27.6 -- re-run the neutral skeleton through a
                  second engine on a 10 % page subsample; document >= 0.95 and every sampled
                  page >= 0.75, else label results PDFIUM-CONDITIONED FRAME. NEVER
                  decision-blocking.
    executable    `cross_engine_result(...)` and `write_cross_engine_control(...)`
    test          `x22_score_input_contract.py`

WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM x09. `x09` is the DEVELOPMENT proof that the mechanism works
and that its faults are detectable; its artifact is explicitly development-only and may not be
consumed as the confirmatory qualification. This module produces the distinct canonical
artifact for the confirmatory population, behind the same VALID execution boundary as every
other confirmatory writer.

THE RULE HAS EXACTLY ONE OWNER, AND IT IS `X09.gate`. This module selects A39.2's sampled rows
and then CALLS that function; it does not recompute the denominator or the thresholds. An
earlier version did recompute them and got both wrong -- it read a `pdfium_lines` key that does
not exist, and scored `matched / pdfium` instead of the frozen `matched / max(pdfium, pymupdf)`.
The larger-count denominator is load-bearing: it makes over-segmentation by EITHER engine lower
agreement, so scoring against PDFium alone made PyMuPDF over-segmentation invisible. Keeping
0.95 / 0.75 / `max(...)` in two independently executable places is what allowed that drift, so
they now live in one place only.

    A45. `write_cross_engine_control` used to index the record inline, so "what this consumer
    requires" existed only as three subscript expressions inside a loop body -- unreachable
    without running the loop, which means running the measurement, which pre-boundary means not
    at all. The canonical producer `execute_study.control_documents` emitted a record without
    `document_sha256`, nothing compared the two shapes, and the mismatch surfaced as a raw
    `KeyError` at execution time with no artifact written.

    Naming the read here makes the requirement callable without measuring anything, which is
    what lets a readiness gate exercise the real handoff on a real descriptor and go RED
    instead of discovering the gap after authorization.

    THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THE WRITER READS THE MEASUREMENT ARGUMENTS from a record, so the
    requirement cannot drift from the use: a fourth field would have to be read here to reach
    `cross_engine_result`, and `handoff_report` would then exercise that too.

    Deliberately NOT a shared constant imported by both sides. A field-name set that the
    producer, the consumer and the test all read from one declaration agrees with itself by
    construction and proves nothing about the boundary.
