"""x09 -- cross-engine control on the NEUTRAL SKELETON, with a frozen acceptance rule.

NOT CONFIRMATORY. DEVELOPMENT documents only.

A19 re-pointed the protocol's 10 % PyMuPDF cross-check at "per-page neutral line counts".
That is insufficient: two engines can both report 30 lines while disagreeing about which
baselines and which glyphs belong to each. A21 replaced counting with a GEOMETRIC
CORRESPONDENCE but adopted no threshold, which left a methodological degree of freedom open
before execution. This file closes it.

THE PROPERTY. The skeleton is PDFium-derived. Both architectures inherit it together, so a
PDFium geometry error cannot bias H against X -- but it CAN move the adjudication unit, and
a reader is entitled to know whether an independent engine sees substantially the same
physical lines.

THE MATCHING RULE (unchanged from A21)

    A PDFium line P matches a PyMuPDF line M iff
        |baseline(P) - baseline(M)| <= 0.5 * median ink height of the PDFium page   and
        x-span overlap / min(span(P), span(M)) >= 0.5
    Greedy by ascending baseline distance, each line used at most once, ties on the lower
    PDFium ordinal. NO TEXT is used anywhere.

WHICH PARTS OF THIS ARE ACTUALLY LIKE-FOR-LIKE. This matters, and phase 3 already measured
it rather than leaving it to inference:

  baseline        LIKE FOR LIKE. Both are pen origins -- PDFium's
                  `FPDFText_GetCharOrigin` y and MuPDF's `char[2]` origin. This is the
                  discriminating half of the rule.
  x extent        NOT identical quantities. PDFium's x0/x1 are INK box edges;
                  `get_texttrace()`'s bbox is CONSTRUCTED from the glyph advance at the pen
                  origin -- `h01` measured `bbox[0] == origin[0]` to 0.0 pt on every
                  character of every sampled document, which no ink box can satisfy, and
                  `h08` traced it to `jm_trace_text_span`'s `x1 = x0 + adv`. So a PyMuPDF
                  line's span starts at the first pen origin and ends at the last advance,
                  while PDFium's starts at the first ink edge and ends at the last. The
                  PyMuPDF span therefore CONTAINS the PDFium span in the ordinary case,
                  and since the overlap denominator is the SMALLER span, the ratio pins to
                  1.0. Observed: `x_overlap_min` is exactly 1.0 on every matched line of
                  both development documents -- the criterion never binds.
                  It is therefore reported as a COARSE GUARD, not as evidence of fine
                  geometric agreement: its real job is to stop two horizontally disjoint
                  lines that happen to share a baseline (the two-column case) from matching.
  vertical box    NOT comparable and NOT compared. PDFium's is a tight ink box; MuPDF's
                  rect uses the span's ascender/descender. Only PDFium's height is used,
                  and only to set the baseline tolerance, so the mismatch cannot leak in.
  count, order    comparable, and both are reported.

No better PyMuPDF field is pursued here. `Font.glyph_bbox` would give ink extents, but
obtaining them means re-deriving each glyph's transform from the trace and is a second
backend study; the baseline comparison already carries the control's weight.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FROZEN GATE
#
# METRIC       per document, over the sampled pages:
#                  matched_fraction = one-to-one matched lines / max(pdfium, pymupdf) lines
#              The denominator is the LARGER count, so over-segmentation by EITHER engine
#              lowers the score. Scoring against PDFium alone would read 1.0 while PyMuPDF
#              saw 300 lines to PDFium's 256.
#
# THRESHOLD    PASS(document) iff  matched_fraction >= 0.95
#                             and  every sampled page has page matched_fraction >= 0.75
#
# WHY THERE.   Development observes 514 of 515 lines matched across two documents, i.e. a
#              disagreement rate of 0.2 %. The document gate permits 5 % -- roughly 25x the
#              observed rate -- and that looseness is deliberate, for a reason that is not
#              statistical modesty alone: the development material is TWO GPO BILLS, while
#              the holdout contains three COMMITTEE REPORTS, a class with two-column pages.
#              A19 already records that a two-column page merges its columns into one
#              neutral line, so on that class the two engines can disagree for a reason
#              internal to the skeleton's design rather than because PDFium is wrong. A gate
#              tuned to bills would fire there and be read as an engine fault. Calibrating a
#              tight threshold on 20 pages of one document class would be pretending this
#              sample establishes a population error rate; it does not.
#
#              The per-page floor exists because a document-level fraction hides exactly the
#              failure that matters: on a 300-line document, one completely divergent
#              26-line page still scores 0.91 and would pass a document gate alone. 0.75 of
#              a ~26-line GPO page means about 6 unmatched lines on one page -- far above
#              anything observed, far below a page-scale frame shift.
#
# WHAT IT PERMITS, PLAINLY. Up to 5 % of a document's lines unmatched, and up to 25 % of any
#              single page's, with no label at all. It is a coarse guard against a frame
#              that has moved, not a precision instrument.
#
# CONSEQUENCE (frozen; execution is NEVER blocked by this gate)
#   PASS everywhere        the skeleton is reported as cross-engine corroborated.
#   FAIL on document d     every RQ1 **and** RQ2 result or table computed on d carries
#                          "PDFIUM-CONDITIONED FRAME". Both are still reported and the
#                          decision rule is unchanged.
#   FAIL on more than a
#   third of sampled docs  the headline qualification applies to BOTH RQ1 and RQ2.
#
# WHY RQ1 IS NOT EXEMPT. An earlier version of this rule said RQ1 was "unaffected" because
# both arms inherit the same frame. That is too strong, and x10 part 9 measured why rather
# than arguing it. A common frame cannot DIRECTLY favour H or X -- and the per-line
# comparative verdict did in fact survive every partition tried, so the overclaim was not
# that a verdict flips. The conditioning enters through the DENOMINATOR AND POPULATION: the
# frame decides how many neutral lines exist, which are in M0's comparative risk set, and
# -- through the 8-line region grid -- which regions enter the D-frame and which are drawn
# into the C-frame. Identical architecture output scored against two different neutral
# partitions of the same glyphs gives different M0 rates. So RQ1's NUMBERS are conditional
# on the PDFium frame even though its DIRECTION is not, and the label belongs on both.
