"""x19 -- A32 raster diagnostic: is the VISIBLE left edge displaced from the geometric x0?

NOT CONFIRMATORY. DEVELOPMENT only, worst-case targets from `x18`. Nothing is scored and no
oracle artifact is created. Evidence: `results/x19_raster_edge_diagnostic.json`.

NARROW PURPOSE, per the A32 contract: does the MuPDF-rendered raster reveal a SYSTEMATIC reason
that "left edge of the first printed character" -- what A30.3 asks the adjudicator for -- would
sit materially away from the neutral glyph's geometric `x0`?

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. No OCR. No pixel-intensity threshold invented and then
treated as truth. The only edge rule used is EXACT RASTER OCCUPANCY: with the page rendered on
a transparent ground, the visible edge is the leftmost pixel column receiving ANY alpha at all.
That is a property MuPDF computes, not a number chosen here.

THE MEASUREMENT IS RESTRICTED GEOMETRICALLY, NOT HEURISTICALLY. A neighbouring glyph's ink
inside the search window would contaminate "leftmost inked column", and separating it would
require exactly the segmentation heuristic the contract forbids. So a target is measured only
when NO other glyph's ink box reaches into its window -- a purely geometric exclusion, decided
from `x18`'s recorded neighbour boxes, with the excluded count reported rather than hidden.

RUN IT WITH AN INTERPRETER THAT HAS `pymupdf`. It is deliberately absent from the project venv:
that venv is shared across worktrees and PyMuPDF is a rejected EXTRACTOR under ADR 0002. Here
it is only the renderer PRE-REGISTRATION 5.2 already names for adjudication stimuli.
