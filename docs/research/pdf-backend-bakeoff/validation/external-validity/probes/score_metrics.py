"""score_metrics -- HARNESS-PLAN section 5. The frozen metric scorer, and NOTHING else.

    owns      PRE-REGISTRATION section 6 (M0-M9 minus M6) and section 8 (via A27.5/A37)
    consumes  committed artifacts ONLY -- frames, oracle key, oracle adjudicated,
              `cross_engine_control.json`, `s1_control.json`, and the committed membership's
              stratum labels
    tests     `x27_score_metrics.py` (SYNTHETIC + DEVELOPMENT only)

WHAT THIS MODULE MAY NOT DO, stated first because the boundary is the point.

It does not run H, run X, open a PDF, select a frame, rebuild a population, reconstruct XML or
PDF source truth, adjudicate anything, run historical repo discovery, or take the architecture
decision. Every fact it needs was made reachable from committed artifacts by A38, and A38.1's
ownership table is the map. `decide_architecture` owns section 7; the Rule 0 / Rule 1 / Rule 3
outcomes are ABSENT here on purpose -- this module emits the facts those rules read, and a
reader can check that no outcome enum appears in what it writes.

NOTHING HERE IS A NEW METHODOLOGICAL RULE. Where a frozen rule already has an executable owner
this module CALLS it rather than restating it, because two copies of a rule are two rules:

    M0 block                `neutral_identity.m0`               (A22/A23)
    M3 boundaries/outcome   `m3_boundaries.heading_outcome`     (A3/A4/section 6.3)
    M2 normalisation        `xml_sources.normalize`             (section 6.2)
    M5 role coarsening      `methodology_contracts.m5_*`        (A36.7)
    section 4.5 adequacy    `methodology_contracts.adequacy`    (A28.1/A28.2/A30.4)
    section 8 zero event    `methodology_contracts.zero_event_upper_bound`
    section 8 bootstrap     `methodology_contracts.section8_document_bootstrap` (A37, A38.10)
    Rule 0 margin clause    `methodology_contracts.margin_line_loss`            (A39.1)
    occurrence join         `build_oracle.resolve_adjudicated_occurrence`       (A38.7)
    adjudication encoding   `build_oracle.validate_adjudicated`                 (A38.7)
    answer routing          `build_oracle.PURPOSE_ROUTE`                        (A36.4)
    cross-engine gate       `cross_engine_control.json`, produced by `X09.gate` (A39.2)

`build_oracle` is imported LAZILY (see `_bo`) because it imports `pymupdf` at module scope.
Consuming committed JSON must not require a PDF renderer merely to import this module; the
delegation itself is unchanged, and `x27` proves the property in a child interpreter where the
renderer cannot be imported at all.

The only quantity this module implements from scratch is the general one-sided
Clopper-Pearson upper bound, which A27.5 assigns to it explicitly and which
`methodology_contracts` deliberately does not carry.

MALFORMED INPUT REFUSES. Every refusal below exists because the alternative -- skipping a
record -- moves a denominator with nothing to show for it, and a smaller denominator reads as a
cleaner result. The refusals are deterministic and carry the offending record.

    TEXT is wrong in both directions: `"NONE"` against an emitted `None` scores a correct root

    answer would count against an architecture for a limit of the ORACLE's field of view. Reading
    a JSON null as "no parent" hid this, because a fixture could satisfy M4 without ever producing
    the representation the adjudicator is actually asked for.

    OFF_REGION LEAVES THE POPULATION, and that is a reading, not an omission. Section 6 fires M4
    on "matched headings whose parent is in-region **or resolvable**", and **no frozen source
    defines a resolver**: `OFF_REGION` appears exactly twice in the whole study -- section 5.3 and
    the prompt -- and neither `build_oracle` nor `methodology_contracts` carries one. Inventing a

    key carrying 7 of 8 N-A controls would otherwise certify a Rule 3 blocker on a smaller census
    than the protocol froze. A key carrying NONE certifies nothing -- every kind reports
    `NOT_EVALUABLE`, which is not a PASS and cannot satisfy Rule 3 -- and refusing it outright would
    make the scorer unrunnable on exactly the DEVELOPMENT and mechanism material it must be tested
    against, including its own real-producer end-to-end check. The confirmatory key carries all 20
    by construction, so the frozen census is enforced wherever it exists.
