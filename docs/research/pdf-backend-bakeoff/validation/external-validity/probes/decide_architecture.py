"""decide_architecture -- section 7.2's rules 0, 1, 2 and 3, made executable.

THE ONLY COMPONENT THAT TAKES THE ARCHITECTURE DECISION. `score_metrics` deliberately records
M9's raw facts and emits `rule0_outcome: None` (A38.8 / A41); the Rule 0 choice, the Rule 1
evaluation, the A10/A27.3 budget and the A27.6 gate vector are all owned here.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO, stated first because every one of them was available:

    it does not recompute a metric          every quantity is read from the scorer's payload
    it does not open a PDF or run an arm    no renderer, no `run_hybrid`, no `run_extended`
    it does not reconstruct oracle truth    no adjudication, no oracle, no answer is read
    it does not alter a population          the frames' committed censuses are read, never rebuilt
    it does not repair a surprising input   a missing or unknown fact REFUSES (see the refusals)

THE FIVE FROZEN OUTCOMES (A10 + A27.4), and nothing else may ever be emitted:

    EXTENDED_BY_RULE_0_M9            H has an asymmetric M9 loss, X has none
    HYBRID_BY_RULE_0_M9              X has an asymmetric M9 loss, H has none
    EXTENDED_BY_RULE_1               X met every Rule 1 condition on a FULL census
    HYBRID_BY_PRIOR                  the pre-stated architectural prior stands
    INSUFFICIENT_COMPARATIVE_EVIDENCE  Rule 1 could not be evaluated, or a Rule 3 gate did not pass

ORDER OF APPLICATION, and where each step's authority is:

    0. input validation                  refuse rather than decide on incomplete facts
    1. M9 evaluability                   section 7.2 rule 3's own item; Rule 0 cannot run without it
    2. RULE 0 (M9)                       section 7.2 rule 0 -- "M9 supersedes everything below",
                                         HARNESS-PLAN section 6 -- "Rule 0 (M9) runs FIRST"
    3. RULE 3 gate vector                A27.6 -- any failure -> INSUFFICIENT
    4. the A10 / A27.3 budget            > 60 D-frame regions -> Rule 1 cannot choose X
    5. RULE 1                            A5 as amended by A20
    6. RULE 2 -- the prior               HYBRID_BY_PRIOR

THE PROHIBITION THAT OUTLIVES THE OUTCOME. "X failed to prove a win because we did not
adjudicate enough items" must never be written as "H empirically beat X" (A10). Hybrid survives
BY PRIOR, and the rendered conclusion is gated against any comparative-accuracy claim for H.

RULE 1'S FOURTH CONDITION IS THE LITERAL PER-HEADING EXISTENTIAL (A42.3, ruled). "No heading whose
immediate parent is correct under H and wrong under X" is read from `score_metrics`' PAIRED fact,
`M4.h_correct_x_wrong`. The per-arm `m4_correct` counts are NOT sufficient and are never
substituted for it: two headings, one wrong under each arm, leave the aggregates equal while the
condition is violated. A D-frame block that carries no paired fact REFUSES.
