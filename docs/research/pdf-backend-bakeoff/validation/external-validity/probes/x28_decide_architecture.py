"""x28 -- HARNESS-PLAN section 6's control table, executed against `decide_architecture`.

NOT CONFIRMATORY. SYNTHETIC only. No holdout document is opened, nothing is adjudicated, no
confirmatory artifact is created, and no real architecture decision is taken. Every outcome this
probe prints is a property of a fixture built here. Evidence: `results/x28_decide_architecture.json`.

RUN WITH AN INTERPRETER CARRYING `pymupdf` AND `pypdfium2`, as `score_metrics` transitively needs.

WHAT THIS PROBE EXISTS TO PROVE, and what would make each half FALSE:

    the decider reads fields the REAL scorer really emits   part_contract -- not a hand-written dict
    every frozen rule can go RED                            the boundary sweeps and part_injection
    exactly five outcomes exist, and all five are reachable  part_enums
    incomplete evidence REFUSES rather than deciding         part_refusals
    a reporting qualification never moves an outcome         part_qualification_never_decides

THE FIXTURE DISCIPLINE, stated because it decides what these numbers are worth. Every payload
starts as REAL `score_metrics.score(...)` output over synthetic frames, so the decider is read
against the producer's own field names and shapes. Where a Rule 3 gate has to be forced to PASS to
reach a later rule, the gate STATUS is overwritten on that real payload and nothing else -- those
statuses are FIXTURES, never evidence, and `part_contract` is what stops the overwrite drifting
onto a field the scorer does not have.
