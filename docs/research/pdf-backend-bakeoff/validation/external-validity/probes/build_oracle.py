"""build_oracle -- HARNESS-PLAN section 4. Builds the two oracle artifacts.

A35. IMPLEMENTS ALREADY-FROZEN RULES AND INTRODUCES NONE. Every rule here is fixed by
PRE-REGISTRATION 5.3-5.8, HARNESS-PLAN section 4, or A19-A34. Where a frozen source does not
determine an outcome-affecting choice the obligation is to STOP and report, never to settle it
here -- see A35.1's forward finding on the M5 coarsening map, which this module neither needs
nor chooses.

WHAT IT PRODUCES, and why the two artifacts differ deliberately:

  PRIVATE KEY   blind id -> canonical pre-blinding identity, document_sha256, page,
                region_ordinal, stratum, frames ["C"]/["D"]/["C","D"] (A36.2), the required
                adjudication routes, control/repeat bookkeeping, the H/X output
                the later join needs, renderer name + version, DPI, committed bbox in PDF
                points, PNG sha256, and the region-line bijection A35.2 records.

  BLIND FILE    ONLY the opaque id, the rendered image, and the question/codebook.

The blind file is what the adjudicator reads. If any private field reaches it, the study's
blinding claim is false, so `leakage_report` gates it executably and `x21` proves the gate can
FAIL by injecting forbidden content rather than trusting inspection.

WHAT THIS MODULE MUST NOT DO. It never renders from any architecture's text; never lets a
region's H/X content influence cropping; never reveals control status; never re-derives
geometry from the PDF; never pads, clips, intersects or repairs a committed bbox; and never
turns a refusal into a skipped stimulus or a smaller denominator.

#
# A35.5 STOPPED here because the frozen sources did not say what happens when a region is in
# BOTH frames. A36 ruled it, and the ruling is implemented rather than re-decided:
#
#   A36.1  C and D are INDEPENDENT predicates and may overlap. Neither frame drops the
#          overlap, the C draw is never replaced after observing D membership, and the frames
#          are never forced disjoint.
#   A36.2  one physical region is ONE stimulus identity -- one base identity, one 300-DPI
#          primary, one PNG, one blind id. A28.3 gains NO frame component; membership is
#          METADATA about a stimulus, carried as an explicit ordered list because the old
#          singular `frame` projection could not represent an overlap unambiguously.
#   A36.3  "never pooled" separates ESTIMANDS, not SETS: the region counts once in each
#          frame's own denominator, and |C union D| is never substituted for either.
#   A36.4  a stimulus and an adjudication are different objects, so one blind stimulus takes
#          both required routes, separately namespaced.
