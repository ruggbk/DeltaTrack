"""x13 -- the corrected X arm, and the invariants it must satisfy. DESIGN MATERIAL.

NOT CONFIRMATORY. Synthetic + DEVELOPMENT documents only. No holdout document is opened,
nothing is scored.

    frozen rule        X-2 (no U+0020 in the contract); 3.3 (clustering, chrome, margin
                       parsing and `_merge_print_lines` held IDENTICAL on both arms);
                       A19 (one neutral skeleton, identical under either arm);
                       A21/A23 (gids carried; inserted spaces carry gid=None)
    executable         `pdfium_extended_corrected` + `reconstruct_extended_corrected`
                       + `run_extended`
    test               this file
    evidence           `results/x13_x_arm.json`

The load-bearing check is SKELETON IDENTITY. X drops every U+0020, so a skeleton derived
from X's own glyphs would omit every content-stream space PDFium boxes -- and would not
equal H's. A19 requires ONE skeleton. Both runners therefore call the same
`run_hybrid.neutral_skeleton`, and this file asserts the result is identical rather than
assuming it.
