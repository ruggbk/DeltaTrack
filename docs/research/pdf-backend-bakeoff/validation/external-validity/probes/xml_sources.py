"""xml_sources -- A40/F1/F2: independent account-heading source truth, from the committed XML.

    frozen rule   A40.3 -- no H or X output may participate in eligibility, ranking or
                  targeting of an N-A/N-B control source
    executable    `account_records()` (XML), `locate_occurrences()` (PDF), `bridge()` (both)
    tests         `x24_xml_source_bridge.py` (source truth), `x25_bridge_validation.py` (the bridge)

NOTHING HERE IMPORTS OR CALLS AN ARCHITECTURE. There is no `run_hybrid`, no `run_extended`, and
no `pdf_anchors.extract_anchors` on any path in this module. `x24` proves that by making all
three raise on import and requiring the source population, eligibility, ranking and selected
identities to come out byte-identical.

WHAT ESTABLISHES "ACCOUNT", AND ON WHOSE AUTHORITY. Both committed DEVELOPMENT sources declare

    <!DOCTYPE bill PUBLIC "-//US Congress//DTDs/bill.dtd//EN" "bill.dtd">
    <bill bill-type="appropriations" ...>

the LEGACY US Congress bill DTD (not USLM). That schema has no `<account>` element -- there are
zero in this corpus -- and expresses the appropriations hierarchy as three flat, non-nesting
sibling levels under `<title>`:

    appropriations-major         the major grouping
    appropriations-intermediate  the agency
    appropriations-small         THE ACCOUNT

The authority for that mapping is GPO's own renderer, not this study's parser: `bills.css` and
`billres-details.xsl` style the three levels distinctly, and `docs/gpo-render-conventions.md`
records the correspondence with `docs/bill-structure.md` documenting the flat-sibling nesting.
The direction matters: the XML CARRIES the hierarchy explicitly and the PDF-side segmentation is
what has to RECOVER it -- so reading the account level off the XML uses the authority, while
reading it off an H anchor's `kind` would be reading the reconstruction under test.

TWO STRUCTURAL FACTS THAT MUST NOT BE ASSUMED AWAY, both measured on the committed files:

  * `header` is a CHILD ELEMENT here, never the attribute the prose examples abbreviate it to
    (105/105 and 41/41 child, 0 attribute). A header-LESS `appropriations-small` is the money
    half of a split account (2 and 3 of them) and carries no printed heading, so it is excluded.

  * THE XML HEADER IS NOT THE PRINTED STRING -- see THREE OBJECTS below.

THREE OBJECTS, NEVER COLLAPSED (A40 section 2).

    semantic source truth      the legacy-DTD structural element and its hierarchy
    rendered expected heading  what GPO's committed rendering convention determines should print
    physical observation       an independently observed whole line + bbox in the DEVELOPMENT PDF

`RENDERED_TEXT_PROVENANCE` records, per dimension, which of the two authorities decides it.
The load-bearing subtlety is that GPO's `billres-details.xsl` / `bills.css` govern GPO's *HTML*
renderer, and THE PUBLISHED PDF IS NOT PRODUCED BY THAT PIPELINE. `docs/gpo-render-conventions.md`
records the measurement that forces this reading (#89): the CSS `em` values predict
agency > body > account, while the PDF measures agency == account < body, "typeset by GPO's
separate photocomposition system, whose point sizes do not track the HTML renderer's `em`
values". So the stylesheet is authoritative for CONTENT (it performs no content edit at this
level, only case transforms) and is NOT authoritative for the PDF's realised CASE:

  * text content / punctuation / whitespace  -> SOURCE-DETERMINED. Every rule recorded at this
    level is a pure case transform; none inserts, deletes or rewrites a character. So the
    printed heading must agree with the XML header exactly, up to case.
  * case                                     -> PHYSICALLY OBSERVED. The XSL lowercases
    (`translate($upper,$lower)`) and the CSS small-caps it for HTML; the PDF prints real
    capitals. Case is therefore read back from the page, never asserted from source.
  * the margin number                        -> PHYSICALLY OBSERVED page furniture, stripped.

`cross_check_rendering()` enforces exactly that split: the observed whole line must equal the
source-determined expectation under case folding ALONE. Any other difference REFUSES. That makes
the independent PDF backend an observation instrument for case and geometry, and never the
source of the account's semantics.

#: What the authorities actually say, none of which conditions on the parent:

#:     DTD gives `appropriations-major/intermediate/small` IDENTICAL CONTENT MODELS and no
#:     defining comments, verified against usgpo/bill-dtd. A content model that does not vary
#:     cannot distinguish a permitted parent, and none is declared.
#:   * `docs/bill-structure.md` level table: `account` is "leaf, tag `appropriations-small` (and
#:     the default)". The level is keyed on the TAG. The same section states the rule directly
#:     for a sibling case -- "the tag is authoritative".
#:   * `docs/gpo-render-conventions.md` casing table and `billres-details.xsl:8279`
#:     (`convertToNeededCase`): the branch is `<xsl:when test="ancestor::appropriations-small">`.
#:     An ELEMENT-TYPE ancestor test with NO parent predicate, so GPO's own renderer applies the
#:     identical template whether the block hangs off `<title>` or `<section>`.
#:   * `bills.css` styles one class per appropriations level, not per parent.
#:
#: So the legacy source applies the same `appropriations-small` role regardless of parent, and
#: all 96 bridged records are account sources. Restoring the exclusion needs new AUTHORITY, not
#: a new correlation.
