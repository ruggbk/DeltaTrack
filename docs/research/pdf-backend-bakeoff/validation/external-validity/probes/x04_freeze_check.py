"""x04 -- audit the freeze and the execution gate. Exit non-zero if execution is forbidden.

PRE-REGISTRATION.md, "Execution gate".

TWO GATES, REPORTED SEPARATELY, because conflating them let this script print
"EXECUTION GATE OPEN" while the protocol's own gate listed two unmet prerequisites it
never checked. Freeze integrity is about whether the protocol and population are honestly
frozen; execution readiness is about whether the machinery the protocol requires exists.
Both must hold before anything may be scored.

FREEZE INTEGRITY
  F1  membership exists, is committed, and records a SHA-256 for every file
  F2  every file on disk still hashes to its recorded SHA-256
  F3  no member appears in any contamination class, or in the design-exposure list
  F4  the pre-registration's LAST-MODIFYING commit is an ancestor of the membership
      commit. First-commit is not enough: it proves only that SOME version of the
      protocol predated the population, which is exactly the hole the external review
      found -- the protocol was materially amended after selection.
  F5  nothing that would count as a confirmatory score exists yet
  F6  the answer key, if it exists, was committed BEFORE the adjudication, by git order

EXECUTION READINESS
  G1  the corrected extended-glyph adapter and reconstructor exist and are committed
  G2  their X2-a / X2-b assertion evidence exists, is committed, and PASSES -- recorded
      on DEVELOPMENT documents, never on the holdout
  G3  the adjudicator prompt exists and is committed
  G6  the committed control-fixture manifest exists and VALIDATES -- N-A/N-B/N-C are Rule 3
      blockers, so a missing or malformed control set keeps execution forbidden even when
      every producer file is present (A39.4)
  G4  the design-exposure list exists and is non-empty

--self-test drives every gate that has a constructible known-bad case and requires each
to fail, because a gate that has never produced a negative cannot tell "ready" from
"blind".
