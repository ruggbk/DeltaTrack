"""x04 -- audit the freeze and the execution gate. Exit non-zero if execution is forbidden.

PRE-REGISTRATION.md, "Execution gate".

TWO GATES, REPORTED SEPARATELY, because conflating them let this script print
"EXECUTION GATE OPEN" while the protocol's own gate listed two unmet prerequisites it
never checked. Freeze integrity is about whether the protocol and population are honestly
frozen; execution readiness is about whether the machinery the protocol requires exists.
Both must hold before anything may be scored.

FREEZE INTEGRITY
  F1  membership exists, is committed, and records a SHA-256 for every file
  F2  every file on disk still hashes to its recorded SHA-256
  F3  no member appears in any contamination class, or in the design-exposure list
  F4  the pre-registration's LAST-MODIFYING commit is an ancestor of the membership
      commit. First-commit is not enough: it proves only that SOME version of the
      protocol predated the population, which is exactly the hole the external review
      found -- the protocol was materially amended after selection.
  F5  nothing that would count as a confirmatory score exists yet
  F6  the answer key, if it exists, was committed BEFORE the adjudication, by git order

EXECUTION READINESS
  G1  the corrected extended-glyph adapter and reconstructor exist and are committed
  G2  their X2-a / X2-b assertion evidence exists, is committed, and PASSES -- recorded
      on DEVELOPMENT documents, never on the holdout
  G3  the adjudicator prompt exists and is committed
  G6  the committed control-fixture manifest exists and VALIDATES -- N-A/N-B/N-C are Rule 3
      blockers, so a missing or malformed control set keeps execution forbidden even when
      every producer file is present (A39.4)
  G4  the design-exposure list exists and is non-empty

--self-test drives every gate that has a constructible known-bad case and requires each
to fail, because a gate that has never produced a negative cannot tell "ready" from
"blind".

TWO EXCEPTIONS, OWNED ELSEWHERE RATHER THAN DUPLICATED. F12 (continuation record) and G7
(result-bearing toolchain) are added by A47, and their known-bad cases live in
`x30_continuation_boundary.py`: a suppressed prior-boundary record, an uncommitted one, a
foreign population, and a version mutation per pinned dependency. They are not repeated
here because two controls failing on the same mutation cost twice to maintain and diagnose.
Named explicitly so the claim above stays true rather than quietly becoming false.

    A49. A pre-execution amendment's chronology is anchored to that amendment's own

    last-modifying commit of every path it once touched, which is not evidence about
    when the amendment happened: it is evidence about who edited that file most
    recently. Once lawful post-boundary deviations exist, the two diverge. A48
    lawfully modified files that twelve genuinely pre-boundary amendments had touched,
    and the gate then reported all twelve as landing after the marker -- refusing a
    lawful integration on the strength of a later commit that says nothing about the
    earlier amendment.

    Two sources, in order:

    1. The amendment's OWN declared `commits`, wherever present. Authoritative: the
       ledger records where each amendment was implemented. EVERY declared commit is
       returned rather than a single "latest", because collapsing them could hide a
       post-boundary commit behind a pre-boundary one, and the boundary rule must see
       each implementation commit individually.

    2. Legacy records that predate the `commits` field: the last modification of the
       amendment's touched files AS VISIBLE AT THE MARKER. Querying history at the
       boundary rather than at HEAD is what makes the answer stable -- later history
       cannot reach back and move it.

    On the legacy path every candidate is by construction reachable from the marker,
    so that path cannot by itself convict an amendment of being post-boundary. That is
    honest rather than lax: a post-boundary SUBSTANTIVE record has to be WRITTEN into
    the ledger to exist at all, and F9 seals PRE-EXECUTION-AMENDMENTS.md against any
    commit after the marker. The enforcement lives there and in the per-commit
    accounting below, neither of which A49 touches.

    Unresolvable declared refs are dropped here rather than convicted: F9 already
    fails closed on them where it resolves declared commits ("declares unknown

    # claim DEVELOPMENT while having been produced on holdout members. So the documents it
    # names are checked against membership directly, and the label is not sufficient.
    # PROVENANCE, not a claim. A hand-written file naming "fake-doc-123" satisfied the
    # previous rule: it was labelled DEVELOPMENT and named no holdout member, so G2 went
    # green while proving only that a file asserts its own success. The evidence must now
    # bind to artifacts that exist in this repository and hash to what it says:
    #   * every fixture path resolves inside the repo and is NOT a holdout member;
    #   * every recorded fixture SHA-256 matches the file on disk;
    #   * the adapter, reconstructor and verifier blob SHAs match the committed files,
    #     so evidence cannot outlive the code that produced it.

        It was declared in NEITHER `pyproject.toml` NOR `uv.lock` when this gate was written,

        population, the COMPLETE current result-bearing surface, and the reviewed deviation
        register. Disclosure in DEVIATIONS.md is not authority. Nothing chains: a further
        change closes the gate again.

    MUTATIONS THAT MUST MAKE THESE FAIL
        Accept a declared deviation without an authorization (control 1). Stop checking
        surface COVERAGE and check only drift (control 10; also control 9, since the
        contracts file is exactly the uncovered one). Drop any identity binding -- marker
        commit, marker blob, freeze commit, membership blob (controls 5, 5b, 6, 6b). Drop
        write-once on either artifact (controls 3, 4). Stop pinning the deviations blob
        (control 8), which is the clause that prevents a rolling licence.

    Every red control is followed by a restore and a re-assertion that the good state is
    green again, so a failure is attributable to the mutation rather than to leftover
    state. A control that can only ever be red proves as little as one that can only be green.
