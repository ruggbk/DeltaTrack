"""Slice 6 phase E: what a reader is actually told when PDF says ``moved``.

Runs the real canonical conversion and the real renderer over the accepted corpus and
records, for every moved hunk, the ``move`` payload the export carries and the
``move-info`` sentence the HTML report shows. Measured at the consumed output rather than
inferred from the classifier, because the canonical value only earns its name if it
describes the fact the UI communicates.

Deliberately does **not** join to the census partitions. The population is the same 165
moved cards either way -- ``pdf_diff_to_canonical`` emits one change per hunk -- and this
probe's question ("what does the reader see") is answered per card without needing to know
which partition produced it. An unused join was removed rather than left in place claiming
a correspondence nothing checked.
