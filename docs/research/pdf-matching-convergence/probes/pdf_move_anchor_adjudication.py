"""Slice 6 phase C: is a changed anchor a changed heading, or a changed line break?

For every round-1 changed-anchor row (partitions B, C and D), print the lines actually
printed on the page around the anchor on both sides. The classification rule reads
``v1_anchor.text != v2_anchor.text``; this shows what the reader would see in the bill,
which is the only way to say whether that inequality is a heading edit or an artifact of
where the heading wrapped.
