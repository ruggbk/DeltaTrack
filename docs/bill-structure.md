# Bill structure: the shared data model

The vocabulary and hierarchy this project parses, for both the XML and PDF paths.
Read this before touching heading/anchor/account detection (`src/deltatrack/parsers/pdf_anchors.py`,
`src/deltatrack/bill_tree.py`) or discussing the account hierarchy (DeltaTrack#54).

## The one non-obvious fact: hierarchy is positional, not nested

GPO appropriations bills carry a logical tree (department → bureau → account), but
the **legacy bill DTD does not physically nest it**. The three account-level
elements have *identical, non-nesting* content models — none can contain another —
and they sit as flat siblings directly under `<title>`:

```
<title enum="I">
  <appropriations-major   header="DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT, ...">   <!-- header-only -->
  <appropriations-intermediate header="Office of the Secretary ...">
  <appropriations-small   header="OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT">
    <text> For necessary expenses ... $X ...                       <!-- the money -->
  <section enum="101.">                                            <!-- a sibling, not a child -->
```

A grouping header like `ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS` is a **header-only**
`appropriations-intermediate` with no body and no child sections; the SEC. sections
it "owns" are *also* flat siblings under the title. The parent-child relationship is
encoded by **reading order + level**, and a parser reconstructs it. `src/deltatrack/bill_tree.py`
does exactly this, tracking `current_major` / `current_intermediate` as it scans
siblings (`_walk_structural_children`).

Not every header-only element is a grouping header. GPO also splits a single account
across **two** siblings — the first carrying the `<header>` and no body, the second the
body and no header — where the print shows one account, its heading directly above its
own text, indistinguishable from the un-split accounts either side of it:

```
<appropriations-intermediate header="United States fish and wildlife service">  <!-- agency -->
<appropriations-small   header="RESOURCE MANAGEMENT">        <!-- the name, no money -->
<appropriations-small>                                       <!-- the money, no name -->
  <text> For necessary expenses ... $1,385,096,000 ...
```

The two shapes are told apart by what follows: a grouping header is followed by sibling
`<section>`s or by further named accounts, a split account by an immediately adjacent
sibling that has a body and no header of its own. `bill_tree.py` joins that pair, so the
moneyed half is addressed under the account's own name rather than under the agency above
it (#474). The split occurs at every level, in both same-tag and cross-tag pairs, and is
not always consistent between versions of the same bill.

This is why glyph size is the right PDF signal (DeltaTrack#89): GPO marks heading
level two mirror-image ways — in XML as a **level tag**, in the PDF as a **font
size** — on an otherwise flat stream. Recovering the level from the size is the
whole game.

## Two interleaved trees under a Title

Conflating these is the root of most confusion:

```
Division A: ...                              (omnibus only)
└─ TITLE I — DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY            ← title
   │
   ├─ MONEY TREE (appropriations hierarchy)
   │  └─ appropriations-major     DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT, ...   department
   │     └─ appropriations-intermediate  Office of the Secretary ...  bureau / AGENCY
   │        └─ appropriations-small   OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT      the ACCOUNT
   │           └─ <text>  "For necessary expenses ... $X"        the appropriation (money)
   │
   └─ PROVISIONS TREE (enacting hierarchy)
      └─ section        SEC. 101.
         └─ subsection  (a)
            └─ paragraph (1)
               └─ subparagraph (A)
                  └─ clause (i)
                     └─ subclause (I)
```

Grouping headers (`ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS`, `GENERAL PROVISIONS`,
`SPENDING REDUCTION ACCOUNT`) are the bridge: header-only money-tree nodes whose
*body* is a run of provisions-tree sections.

## Glossary

| Term | Role | Bill-DTD tag | PDF signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Division | Top split (omnibus) | `division` | "Division A" heading |
| Title | Major division | `title` | largest heading band |
| Major | Department / large org unit | `appropriations-major` | large heading band |
| Intermediate | Bureau / **agency** | `appropriations-intermediate` | mid heading band |
| Account | Budget line that holds money | `appropriations-small` | small-caps heading band |
| Appropriation paragraph | "For necessary expenses... $X" | `text` under the account | body size |
| Section | Numbered provision (SEC. 101) | `section` | "SEC." at body size |
| Subsection / paragraph / subparagraph / clause / subclause | Provision nesting | same names | enum markers |
| enum / header | The marker / the heading text | `enum` / `header` | margin number / line text |

"Agency vs account" (DeltaTrack#54) is **intermediate vs small** in this vocabulary.

### Emitted `level` vocabulary (the canonical structure tree, #108)

The leveled tree (`src/deltatrack/structure_tree.py`, exposed as the canonical `tree` field) labels
every node with one `level` from a **shared 9-value enum** both pipelines map into, so
the contract speaks one language and the renderer branches on data, not source
(`schema/canonical-diff.schema.json` → `TreeNode.level`). The enum names are *budget
roles*, not DTD tag names — note `Intermediate` (the tag) surfaces as the level
`agency`. The two pipelines derive a level differently, and that asymmetry is real:

| `level` | XML source (`_LEAF_LEVEL` / `_interior_level`) | PDF source (`AnchorKind`) |
|---|---|---|
| `division` | interior, synthesized from the `display_path` prefix | synthesized division root |
| `title` | interior, synthesized (`TITLE <roman>`) | `title` anchor |
| `major` | **leaf**, tag `appropriations-major` | `major` anchor |
| `agency` | **leaf**, tag `appropriations-intermediate` | `agency` anchor |
| `account` | **leaf**, tag `appropriations-small` (and the default) | `account` anchor |
| `section` | **leaf**, tag `section` | `section` anchor |
| `subsection` | **leaf**, tag `subsection` (every direct non-quoted one, #188) | `subsection` anchor (run-in `(a) …—`, catchline-bearing only, #96) |
| `grouping` | — *(surfaces as `heading`; see below)* | `grouping` anchor |
| `preamble` | **leaf**, tag `front-matter` | `preamble` anchor |
| `heading` | interior fallback: any synthesized container that is not a division/title | — *(PDF anchors are always typed)* |

The asymmetry to keep in mind: **XML interior levels are positional, not typed.** XML
emits a standalone node only for nodes that carry a body (the leaf tags above); the
department/agency/grouping *containers* above them have no node of their own (the
"hierarchy is positional, not nested" fact above), so the tree synthesizes them from
the `display_path` and labels them `heading` — including grouping headers, which on
the **PDF** side are a typed `grouping` anchor. So `grouping` is PDF-only, `heading` is
XML-only, and an agency/major that is a *synthesized container* (not a body-bearing
leaf) is `heading` on XML but `agency`/`major` on PDF. The leaf levels
(`major`/`agency`/`account`/`section`/`preamble`) and `division`/`title` agree on both.
`subsection` is emitted by both pipelines, at different depths by design (#96/#188):
XML emits **every** direct, non-quoted `<subsection>` as a node (the tag is
authoritative — bare `(a)` subdivisions and roman-enum subsections included), while
the PDF detector recovers only the **catchline-bearing** subset (a run-in
`(a) Catchline.—` renders inline at body size; a bare `(a)` leaves no detectable
signature, and roman-lookalike enums are rejected). So the XML tree sits deeper than
the PDF tree on bare subsections — the same detection-path-dependent-depth class as
`major`/`agency` (ADR 0012), pointing the right way: the primary source is the deeper
one. On the catchline-bearing set the two pipelines converge exactly (gated in
`tests/test_xml_subsection_nodes.py`).

**Where these terms come from (two separate sources, do not conflate them):**

- The **tag names** (`title`, `appropriations-*`, `section`, `enum`, `header`) are
  defined by the GPO **bill DTD** — the markup the project parses. Their *structure*
  is authoritative; their *meaning* is not (see caveat below).
- The **budget meaning** (department → bureau → **account**, and "account" as the
  unit that holds money) comes from the federal budget-account structure, not the
  markup: GAO defines an *appropriation account* as the unit that "record[s] amounts
  appropriated by law" ([GAO Glossary, GAO-05-734SP](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-05-734sp)),
  and the agency/bureau/account organization is the President's Budget account
  structure in [OMB Circular A-11 (2025)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a11.pdf).
  That appropriations bills are organized *by account* is described in
  [CRS R42388, *The Congressional Appropriations Process*](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42388).

### Caveat: the level tags are convention, not semantics

The bill DTD gives `appropriations-major/intermediate/small` **identical content
models and no defining comments** (verified against [bill.dtd](https://github.com/usgpo/bill-dtd/blob/master/bill.dtd))
— the three differ only by which tag GPO's typesetters chose. The
department/bureau/account mapping is observed convention, and GPO applies it loosely:
in H.R. 8752, `GENERAL PROVISIONS` is tagged `appropriations-major` while
`Administrative provisions` is `appropriations-intermediate`. Treat the tag as a level
hint cross-checked against the budget-account meaning above, not a guaranteed semantic.

### Section subdivision ladder (HOLC)

Within a section, the House Office of the Legislative Counsel fixes the order and
designation style ([HOLC *Quick Guide to Legislative Drafting*](https://legcounsel.house.gov/holc-guide-legislative-drafting),
rev. June 2026):

| Level | Designation | Example |
|---|---|---|
| subsection | lower-case letter | `(a)` |
| paragraph | arabic numeral | `(1)` |
| subparagraph | upper-case letter | `(A)` |
| clause | lower-case roman | `(i)` |
| subclause | upper-case roman | `(I)` |

(`item` / `subitem` exist as the 6th/7th levels.) Higher units above a section, when
present: `title I`, `subtitle A`, `chapter 1`, `subchapter A`, `part I`, `subpart 1`.

## PDF ↔ XML parity (the goal, and where we stand)

The aim is for the PDF parser to reconstruct the **same structure** `src/deltatrack/bill_tree.py`
recovers from XML, so a diff means the same thing on either input.

**Is the tree+rollup intent solved on the XML side? No — only partially.** Both paths
fall short of the parent/child + money-rollup model, in different ways:

- **XML side** (`src/deltatrack/bill_tree.py`): does *positional reconstruction*, but the output is a
  **flat `list[BillNode]`**, not a tree. Each node carries its ancestry as a
  `match_path` / `display_path` tuple (enough for breadcrumbs and cross-version
  matching), but there is **no `parent`/`children` object, no money rollup, and
  header-only grouping nodes are dropped** (e.g. `ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS` has no
  `<text>` body, so it produces no node and cannot parent its sections). So the XML
  recovers per-node *paths*, not a navigable tree with aggregation.
- **PDF side** (`src/deltatrack/parsers/pdf_anchors.py`): emits a **flat anchor list** with three
  kinds (`title`, `section`, `account`) and infers breadcrumbs by walking up by
  position (`breadcrumb_for`). It has only *one* money-tree level (`account`); it
  cannot yet mirror major/intermediate/small or roll money up.

Net: "match the XML" is necessary but **not sufficient** — the XML target is itself
flat-node-with-path, so the parent/child + rollup vision below requires evolving
**both** pipelines, not just porting the PDF side to parity with today's XML.

Closing the gap (DeltaTrack#54 and beyond — applies to both pipelines):

1. Assign each heading a **level**, not a single `account` flag — but the signal is
   weaker than "read the level off the size band" implies: glyph size splits only
   body-vs-heading, not the three account levels (see *What the PDF signal can and
   cannot recover* below).
2. Build a real **tree** by reading order + level (the XML reconstruction, applied
   to glyph sizes).
3. **Nest sections under their header parent**, so `SPENDING REDUCTION ACCOUNT` owns
   `SEC. 513`.
4. **Roll amounts up**: account → bureau → department → title. Block-level changes
   then assign and aggregate money along the same parent/child edges.

### What the PDF signal can and cannot recover (DeltaTrack#54 finding)

Re-checked against the corpus 2026-06-27. Glyph size yields **two** bands, not
three: a body band (~14pt) and a single heading band (~11.2pt small-caps) that holds
*both* `appropriations-intermediate` and `-small`. Casing does **not** rescue the
split — an agency header that is title-case in the XML `header`
(`Management directorate`) extracts **ALL-CAPS** in heading position
(`MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE`); small-caps flattens to caps in PDF text, so it is
lexically indistinguishable from an all-caps account header. `Line` carries no
x-position, so indentation/centering is not a usable signal either.

What that leaves recoverable from PDF-only input, keyed on *what follows* a
heading-band line:

| Heading form (XML tag) | What follows it in the PDF | PDF-recoverable? |
|---|---|---|
| Major (department), `appropriations-major` | body-size + uppercase, sits above the band | Yes, with a dedicated detector |
| Intermediate **carry-over** (one agency over ≥2 accounts) | another heading-band line | **Yes** — today silently dropped |
| Intermediate **grouping header** (`ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS`) | a `SEC.` line | **Yes** — today mislabeled `account`; the `SEC.` is detectable |
| Intermediate **prose-leading** (agency → "For necessary expenses…") | appropriation prose | **No** — identical to an account by size, case, and position |
| Account, `appropriations-small` | appropriation prose | Yes |

The unrecoverable row is not an edge case: prose-leading intermediates are the
**majority** of the agency level in many bills (H.R. 8774 Defense: 59 of 67;
H.R. 5895 Energy-Water: 37 of 44). Only H.R. 8752 and S. 2625 in the working corpus
have none, which is why H.R. 8752 alone can look like full agency recovery. So on
PDF-only input the agency level is recoverable only in its carry-over and
grouping-header forms; the prose-leading form is not separable from an account by any
signal currently extracted. On the XML side all three levels are present in the path
tuples (`display_path` / `match_path`), even though they are dropped as standalone
nodes.

## Why not USLM?

USLM ([United States Legislative Markup](https://github.com/usgpo/uslm)) is GPO's
successor schema. It is **natively hierarchical** — generic `<level>` elements with
`@class`, explicit `<num>`/`<heading>`, nested rather than flat — so it would model
the parent/child tree we reconstruct by hand from the legacy DTD. That makes "why
aren't we just using USLM?" an obvious and recurring question. The short answer:
**it doesn't cover our inputs.** The detail:

| Question | Finding |
|---|---|
| Are bills in USLM? | Only **enrolled** bills (the final passed version), and still **beta**. |
| How far back? | 113th Congress (2013) forward for enrolled bills; Statutes at Large from 108th. |
| Does it cover the versions we diff? | **No.** We diff introduced → reported → engrossed → enrolled. Every non-enrolled stage exists only in the legacy bill DTD (and PDF). |
| Does it help the PDF path? | **No.** Draft / pre-introduction bills are PDF-only — no XML in *either* schema. |
| Is the legacy DTD going away? | Not announced. Enrolled bills that gain USLM keep the bill DTD alongside it. |

Why this is inappropriate for our use case, not just inconvenient: the product's value is
catching changes *as a bill moves* (markup, floor, conference). That work happens
**before** enrollment, and many appropriations bills never enroll standalone at all —
they are absorbed into an omnibus. USLM, being enrolled-only, structurally cannot see
the versions we exist to compare.

**Disposition:** tracked option, not an adoption. Where an enrolled USLM rendition
exists, it could serve as an *additional* validation cross-check against our bill-DTD
parse. Revisit if GPO extends USLM to non-enrolled bill versions and exits beta.
