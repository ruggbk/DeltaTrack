# Decision records

This directory holds Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): short, numbered notes
that capture a non-obvious choice, why it was made, and what follows from it. They
keep the reasoning from being lost and stop settled questions from being
relitigated.

**Where a rationale belongs.** A comment states the live rule; a defended design
choice past about six lines belongs here, reached by a self-contained pointer that
still carries its claim if the record is never opened (see "Comments and rationale"
in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)). Because nothing loads this directory
automatically, AGENTS.md also carries an index of every record under "Architecture
decisions", so the decision set is visible in a session that never opens a file
here. Write the heading as `# N. <the decision, as a claim>`: the titles are what
the index shows, and a topic label ("Deterministic Diff Engine") tells a reader
nothing that was decided. `tests/test_adr_index.py` regenerates both that index and
the Records table below from these files and fails if either disagrees, so adding a
record means updating both.

## How to propose a decision

1. Copy [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) to `NNNN-short-title.md`, using the next free
   number (zero-padded, sequential, never reused).
2. Fill in Context / Decision / Consequences and set `Status: Proposed`.
3. Open a pull request. The decision is discussed and approved on the PR.
4. On approval a maintainer changes the status to `Accepted` and merges.

## Rules that keep the log trustworthy

- **One decision per file.**
- **Append-only.** Once a record is accepted, its substance is not edited. Numbers
  are never reused and records are not deleted.
- **Supersede, do not overwrite.** To change a past decision, write a new record
  that replaces it: set the old one to `Superseded by NNNN`, and note
  `Supersedes MMMM` in the new one. The old record stays as history.
- **Decision status, not implementation status.** A record's status describes the
  standing of the *decision*, not whether it has been built. Implementation
  progress lives in the issue tracker, so an accepted but unbuilt decision links to
  its tracking issue rather than inventing a status for it.

## Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Proposed | Drafted and under review; not yet agreed. |
| Accepted | Agreed and in effect; the choice the project currently follows. |
| Superseded by NNNN | Replaced by a later decision; kept for history. |
| Deprecated | No longer applies, with no direct replacement. |
| Rejected | Considered and decided against; kept to record why not. |

## Records

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| [0001](0001-structured-money-diff.md) | Diff a structured model of the bill, not document text |
| [0002](0002-pdfium-single-engine.md) | Use pypdfium2 (PDFium) as the single PDF text engine |
| [0003](0003-pdfjs-client-side-viability.md) | Client-side PDF.js extraction is viable for published bills |
| [0004](0004-govinfo-bulk-data.md) | Fetch bill discovery and text from govinfo bulk data, not the Congress.gov API |
| [0005](0005-deltatrack-billtrax-boundary.md) | Keep DeltaTrack a contained two-version tool; put analysis in BillTrax |
| [0006](0006-canonical-diff-contract.md) | Make a versioned JSON document the contract between the diff engine and its consumers |
| [0007](0007-single-renderer.md) | Render every diff with one renderer, whatever source pipeline produced it |
| [0008](0008-deterministic-engine.md) | Keep the diff engine deterministic; a language model may read a diff, never compute one |
| [0009](0009-validation-ground-truth.md) | Validate the parser against independently-authored committee reports |
| [0010](0010-pdf-pipeline-pre-publication.md) | Support a PDF pipeline for pre-publication bills; prefer XML once published |
| [0011](0011-local-only-processing.md) | Process user-provided bill content only on the user's machine; no channel may send it off-device |
| [0012](0012-pdf-heading-levels.md) | Recover PDF heading levels from deterministic geometry; accept the prose-leading agency gap |
| [0013](0013-bill-storage-and-version-identity.md) | Bill identity is the slug; version is a per-bill ordinal, not a universal one |
| [0014](0014-leveled-heading-tree-scope.md) | Ship the recoverable heading levels as a conservation-checked tree; defer semantic rollup |
| [0015](0015-corpus-test-fixtures.md) | Commit a curated corpus fixture set and collect the gates from a manifest |
| [0016](0016-product-tooling-surface-split.md) | Separate the product, the acquisition tooling, and the delivery channel in the layout |
| [0017](0017-installable-engine-package.md) | Ship the diff engine as an installable `src/deltatrack` package |
| [0018](0018-text-triggers-are-financial-only.md) | Read appropriations phrases for money, never for structure |
