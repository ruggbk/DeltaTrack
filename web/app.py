"""FastAPI service exposing the DeltaTrack PDF diff engine.

Stateless by design: uploaded PDFs live only for the duration of a request (in a
temp dir deleted immediately by ``compare_pdfs``), nothing is persisted, and the
result is returned to the caller. No analytics, no per-client logging — this
honors the "your session is not tracked" promise shown in the UI.

The single interactive endpoint is ``POST /api/compare``: upload a start PDF and
an end PDF, get back a standalone HTML diff report (default) or canonical JSON
(``?output=json``).

    prefixes must not get a fresh bucket each time). Local dev has no proxy

# refused request costs nothing. slowapi's own middleware deliberately skips
# any route carrying a decorator, so the two cannot be combined.
#
# The limit therefore applies to every route with a resolvable handler, which
# today is only /api/compare — the StaticFiles mount has no endpoint and is

# limited unless it opts out via @limiter.exempt), but it does mean a future
