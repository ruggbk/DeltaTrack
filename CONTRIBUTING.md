# Contributing to DeltaTrack

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project compares versions of U.S. appropriations bills to make the legislative process more transparent. Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and bug reports.

New to the codebase or to congressional bills? Two things are worth reading first:

- **[docs/bill-structure.md](docs/bill-structure.md)** -- the data model the whole project rests on: what a division, account, or section is, and how the XML and PDF paths reconstruct the bill's hierarchy. Read this before touching parsing or diff code.
- **[docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/)** -- short records of the non-obvious choices and why they were made.

## Community

DeltaTrack is built by the Congressional Tech team at [Civic Tech DC](https://luma.com/civic-tech-dc). The work focuses on diffing draft versions of bills for congressional staffers, across two repos: **BillTrax** (online) and **DeltaTrack** (local). The fastest way to get oriented and find people to pair with:

- **Join the Slack** -- the [`#congressional-tech` channel](https://civictechdc.slack.com/archives/C0AT13U25V2) in the Civic Tech DC workspace. Day-to-day questions and coordination happen here.
- **Come to the biweekly meetup** -- in person, via [Civic Tech DC on Luma](https://luma.com/civic-tech-dc). The single best way to get started: come, say hello, and pick up a first issue with someone alongside you.

You don't need either to send a pull request, but both make the on-ramp much shorter.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12** -- pinned in `.python-version`, and uv installs it for you, so you do not need a matching system Python. Whatever `python3 --version` says is not what the project runs.
- **uv** (Python package manager) -- install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Git** -- for version control

### Setup

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DeltaTrack.git
cd DeltaTrack

# Install dependencies (including dev tools)
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hooks (runs linting/formatting automatically on commit)
uv run pre-commit install

# Run the fast test suite to verify everything works
uv run pytest -m "not slow and not browser"
```

`.python-version` is what makes everyone, and CI, run the same interpreter. Without it uv
picks the first version satisfying `requires-python = ">=3.12"`, which on a machine with a
newer system Python is that newer one, while CI stays on 3.12. Nothing fails at install
time when that happens, so the divergence only shows up later as a test result you cannot
reproduce anywhere else.

**If you already had an environment before this was pinned**, uv reuses an existing
`.venv`'s interpreter rather than reselecting, so the pin does not apply to it. Recreate it
once:

```bash
rm -rf .venv && uv sync
uv run python -V   # expect 3.12.x
```

### The test suite needs no downloads

`uv run pytest` runs on a fresh clone without fetching a single bill (the browser tests
want a one-time `uv run playwright install chromium`; nothing else does). The bills the
integration and correctness gates read are committed to the repo, named in
[`tests/corpus_manifest.toml`](tests/corpus_manifest.toml) ([ADR
0015](docs/decisions/0015-corpus-test-fixtures.md)), so every machine and CI collect the
same set. If a manifested bill is missing the gate fails rather than quietly asserting
less, which is why there is no "download this first" step to forget.

What a download still changes is narrow: the live-network govinfo parity gate (skipped
unless you pass `--run-network`), and a handful of individual cases pinned to a bill
version that is deliberately not committed, which skip when it is absent. No gate loses
its assertions that way. TESTING.md's [What still wants a
download](TESTING.md#what-still-wants-a-download) is the current list.

Downloading bills is for working *beyond* the committed set — exploring a bill the
corpus doesn't cover, or sweeping your local tree with `CORPUS_SWEEP=1`. No API key
needed; `fetch_bills.py` reads keyless govinfo bulk data by default (a key is only for
`--source api` or `download-all` year-range discovery: get a free one at
https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/ and `cp .env.example .env`).

```bash
# --format both gets XML + PDF; the default is XML only
uv run python tools/fetch_bills.py download 118 hr 4366 --format both
```

## Finding work to do

Work is tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AgoraDMV/DeltaTrack/issues) and on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/AgoraDMV/projects/1). An issue moves across the board left to right:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Backlog** | Captured, but not yet groomed or ready to start. |
| **Ready** | Groomed and safe to pick up -- **start here**. |
| **In progress** | Someone is actively working it. |
| **In review** | A pull request is open and awaiting review. |
| **Done** | Merged and complete. (Pull requests land on `develop`; `main` is the protected release branch.) |

To pick up work:

1. Choose an issue from **Ready**, or one labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/AgoraDMV/DeltaTrack/labels/good%20first%20issue) if you're new.
2. **Claim it** so two people don't start the same thing: comment on the issue to call it. If you have write access, also assign yourself and move the card to **In progress**; otherwise a maintainer will. We're a small team and work mostly async between syncs, so visible ownership matters.

The board handles the later transitions for you: opening a pull request with `Closes #<n>` moves the issue to **In review**, and merging it moves the issue to **Done** and closes it. The only card you move by hand is **In progress**, when you start work.

Not sure whether an issue is a good fit? Ask in a comment or at the regular sync (see [Community](#community)).

## Making changes

### Branch workflow

`develop` is the integration branch; `main` is the protected release branch. Day-to-day
work targets `develop`, not `main`. Promoting `develop` to `main` is a separate,
maintainer-initiated step: see [docs/release.md](docs/release.md).

1. Create a branch from `develop` for your work
2. Make your changes in small, focused commits
3. Push your branch and open a pull request against `develop`

**Branch from `develop`, not from another feature branch.** Even when one piece
of work logically follows another, prefer not to stack pull requests: until the
parent merges, the child's diff shows both branches' commits, which makes review
noisy. If you do stack one, the retargeting mechanics now work in the common
case: this repo has "Automatically delete head branches" turned on
([#88](https://github.com/AgoraDMV/DeltaTrack/issues/88), the issue that tracked
enabling it), and it is the parent branch's *deletion* on merge that makes GitHub
retarget the child pull request at `develop`. That is also the edge to watch: if
the parent branch was kept alive or restored after merge, no retarget happens,
and the child then merges into a stale branch — it shows **MERGED** in the UI
while its content never reaches `develop`, and the badge cannot tell you the
difference. When in doubt, confirm the content actually landed:

```bash
git fetch origin develop
git cat-file -e origin/develop:path/to/changed/file && echo "reached develop"
```

### Code style

This project uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting. If you installed the pre-commit hooks, this runs automatically on each commit. You can also run it manually:

```bash
uv run ruff check .          # Lint
uv run ruff check --fix .    # Lint and auto-fix
uv run ruff format .         # Format
```

### Adding a CLI command

A command is an **executable `.py` file in the project root or in `tools/`**. That is the whole
definition, and it is what the documentation gate keys on, so a new command is
discovered automatically and is required to be documented. To add one:

1. Create `<name>.py` in the project root with a shebang. `#!/usr/bin/env python3` is
   the common form; the two bulk fetchers use `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --quiet python`,
   which resolves the environment itself rather than relying on `source ./init`.
   **Put the implementation in `src/deltatrack/` and keep the root file a wrapper** if
   the command is part of the engine (`diff_bill.py`, `diff_pdf.py` are the pattern).
   A module inside a package cannot be executed directly — doing so puts the package's
   own directory on `sys.path`, so `deltatrack` is not importable from within it — which
   is why the command and its implementation are two files rather than one (ADR 0017).
   Re-export `build_parser` from the wrapper, or step 3's gate finds nothing to walk.
2. `chmod +x <name>.py`, and commit the bit (`git update-index --chmod=+x <name>.py`
   if it did not survive). Without it the file reads as a module and is not a command.
3. Expose the argument parser as `build_parser()` returning an `argparse.ArgumentParser`.
   The gate calls it to enumerate subcommands, so each subcommand is documented
   individually rather than the script as a whole.
4. Add a row to the README's **Command reference** table for the script (or one per
   subcommand), spelled exactly as a user types it: `./<name>.py <subcommand>`.
5. Add `<name>` to the completeness floor in `tests/test_docs_consistency.py`
   (`test_the_command_gate_actually_found_commands`). The floor names every command
   rather than counting them, so an unnamed command that later loses its executable
   bit drops out of discovery with the suite still green. The step-2 check catches
   that only for a script carrying a `__main__` block; for one that parses at module
   level, this floor is the only thing standing between it and a silent exit.

`tests/test_docs_consistency.py` names what is missing where it can: skip step 4 and it
fails with the exact row to add, skip step 2 and it fails with `Root scripts look
runnable but are not executable`. Steps 1, 3 and 5 it cannot check for you:

- A shebang is never required on its own. Paired with a `__main__` block on a file
  that lacks the executable bit, it is what raises that step-2 failure.
- A command with no `build_parser` is documented under its bare script name rather
  than rejected (`tools/fetch_bill_archives.py`, [#10](https://github.com/AgoraDMV/DeltaTrack/issues/10)).
- Nothing ties the floor's list back to what discovery found, which is why step 5 is
  a step and not an assertion.

`.py` files that are *not* commands (`tools/fetch_govinfo.py`, `src/deltatrack/bill_tree.py`) simply
carry no executable bit. Discovery covers two roots, the project root and `tools/`, and
spells each command with the path a user types.

Root scripts once shipped a bare-name symlink beside them (`fetch_bills` pointing at
`tools/fetch_bills.py`) so the `.py` could be dropped from the invocation. Those are gone
([#319](https://github.com/AgoraDMV/DeltaTrack/issues/319)): the symlink was cosmetic,
and making "is a root symlink" the definition of a command meant anything else linked
into the root, such as a corpus directory linked in from another checkout, was reported
as an undocumented command.

### Testing

Tests are split into groups by speed and dependencies:

- **Fast tests** (`uv run pytest -m "not slow and not browser"`) -- unit tests on inline XML and mocked data; no bill files needed.
- **Browser tests** (`uv run pytest -m browser`) -- Playwright/Chromium front-end tests. One-time setup: `uv run playwright install chromium`. The default tier skips when Chromium can't launch; CI's dedicated step passes `--run-browser` so a launch failure there fails the run instead of skipping into a green no-op (#599).
- **Slow tests** (`uv run pytest -m slow`) -- integration and external-validation tests against real bill files. Nearly all of them run in CI against fixtures committed to the repo, so they need no downloads and their counts are reproducible; the corpus correctness gates additionally fail closed if a manifested bill is uncommitted. The exception is the live-network govinfo parity gate, marked `network` and skipped unless you pass `--run-network`. `CORPUS_SWEEP=1` opts into sweeping both trees — the committed fixtures plus every locally-fetched bill under `bills/` — for non-CI exploration. [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) has the details and says which suites still want a download.

Adding or renaming a CLI subcommand? Add its row to the README "Command reference" table in the same change -- `tests/test_docs_consistency.py` introspects each root command script's parser and fails if a command has no row. Adding a whole new command? See ["Adding a CLI command"](#adding-a-cli-command) above for the convention the gate enforces.

When adding code, write tests for it. Test files live in `tests/`; mark tests that need real XML files with `@pytest.mark.slow`, front-end tests with `@pytest.mark.browser`, and anything fetching from a live external service with `@pytest.mark.network`. Shared helpers are in `tests/conftest.py`. [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) is the home for the full command catalog and what each validation layer proves.

Adding a committed corpus fixture? Follow the fixture-selection guidance in [ADR 0015](docs/decisions/0015-corpus-test-fixtures.md).

### What CI checks

Every pull request runs the gates defined in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml), which is the source of truth. Run the equivalent locally before pushing:

```bash
uv run ruff check .                          # 1. Lint
uv run ruff format --check .                 # 2. Formatting (run `ruff format .` to fix)
uv run pytest -m "not slow and not browser"  # 3. Fast tests
uv run pytest -m browser --run-browser         # 4. Browser tests (needs `playwright install chromium`; `--run-browser` mirrors CI's fail-closed step)
uv run pytest -m slow \
  --deselect tests/test_govinfo_corpus_parity.py   # 5. Every slow gate CI runs
```

CI splits gate 5 across three steps so a red build names the area it came from; run whole it covers all of them, against vendored and committed fixtures, with no downloads or API key. The deselection is CI's one deliberate omission: a live-network gate that cannot run offline.

Selecting by marker means a module joining a CI step is covered here automatically. History: #220, #320, #288 — this block enumerated each step's modules and went stale in three consecutive pull requests, because nothing ties prose to the workflow.

The pre-commit hooks cover gates 1 and 2 on each commit, but `ruff format --check` still fails CI if you committed without them.

If a slow run ends in `undeclared skip ceiling exceeded`, that is not a flake: a watched gate skipped instead of asserting, and the skip is not declared. [TESTING.md](TESTING.md#when-a-skip-has-to-be-declared) says which allowlist it belongs in.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Run the CI gates locally (above) and make sure they pass.
2. Open a pull request against `develop`.
3. In the description, link the issue it addresses ("Closes #123") and say what changed and why.
4. For a behavior change, note how you verified it -- not just "tests pass," but what you ran or eyeballed (see [Reviewing a pull request](#reviewing-a-pull-request)).
5. For a bug fix, show the test failing without the fix. A test that passes with or without your change doesn't prove the bug is gone.
6. If you used an AI coding assistant, say so (see below).

A maintainer reviews and merges. CI must be green.

### How a merge lands: the merge queue

`develop` sits behind a **merge queue**, so a maintainer approving your pull
request *enqueues* it rather than merging it on the spot. GitHub then builds a
temporary branch holding your changes on top of everything ahead of you in the
queue, runs the required checks against that, and merges only if they pass.

The reason is that a pull request's own checks test its head merged into
`develop` **as `develop` stood when the run happened**. If `develop` moves
afterwards the green check stays green, and it is now answering about a merge
nobody is performing. That is the normal case here, not a rare one: across the 27
merges in the 36 hours before 2026-07-29, 18 landed on a check that predated a
change to `develop` ([#416](https://github.com/AgoraDMV/DeltaTrack/issues/416) has
the measurement). Usually the changes are compatible and nothing happens. Once
they weren't, and `develop` spent hours importing a package a merge in between had
moved ([#406](https://github.com/AgoraDMV/DeltaTrack/issues/406)). The queue tests
the merge that is actually about to happen.

What it changes for you:

- **Merging is not instant.** Your pull request waits while its merge-group
  checks run — roughly the length of one CI run.
- **You still don't rebase on `develop` before merging.** The queue does that work,
  which is why it was chosen over requiring every branch to be up to date; that
  alternative would force a rebase and a fresh CI run on every open branch each
  time `develop` moved. #416 records both options and the measurements behind the
  choice.
- **If your merge-group checks fail**, your pull request is dropped from the queue
  with the reason posted to its timeline, and the queue rebuilds without it. The
  pull requests behind you are not blocked. Fix it and re-queue.

### AI-assisted contributions

They're welcome, and we ask you to disclose them: one line in the pull request
description naming the tool is enough. Disclosure tells a reviewer where to look
harder; it isn't held against the change. The bar is the same either way, and
it's the bar this project already had:

- **You're the author.** Be ready to explain why the change is written the way it
  is and to answer review comments yourself. "That's what the model produced"
  isn't an answer, and a change nobody can defend can't be merged.
- **Run it before you send it.** Generated evidence isn't evidence. A test result
  or benchmark quoted in a description that nobody actually ran costs a reviewer
  more than claiming nothing at all, because it looks like proof.
- **One concern per pull request.** A model will happily fix six things at once,
  and a reviewer can't verify that.

A change that clears these is welcome however it was written. One that doesn't
gets closed, also however it was written.

## Reviewing a pull request

Review is how a small team shares context and catches the bugs tests miss. New teammates are encouraged to review early -- it's one of the fastest ways to learn the codebase.

What to look at, roughly in priority order:

- **Correctness of the diff itself.** This is the product. Passing tests are necessary, not sufficient: a diff can be green and still wrong. For any change that affects diff output, **run the tool on a real bill and eyeball the report** rather than trusting the suite alone. `scripts/serve_compare.py` gives a side-by-side view (see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)).
- **The risk hotspots**, where a bug does the most damage:
  - **Parser accuracy** (`src/deltatrack/bill_tree.py`, `src/deltatrack/parsers/`) -- does the bill's structure come through intact? A missing or mis-nested section corrupts everything downstream. See [docs/parser-validation.md](docs/parser-validation.md).
  - **Financial diff** (`src/deltatrack/diff_bill.py` and its financial filtering) -- dollar amounts and their changes must be exact.
  - **The canonical schema contract** (`src/deltatrack/formatters/canonical.py`) -- both pipelines and the renderer depend on it, so a breaking change there ripples everywhere.
- **Tests for the change.** New behavior should come with a test that would fail without the fix. Judge that by the red-green delta on your own machine rather than by the totals the author reported, and compare like-for-like selections — [TESTING.md](TESTING.md#reading-test-counts) explains what a count does and does not tell you, including which differences are a fail-open signal rather than an environment difference.
- **Docs and decisions.** A non-obvious choice belongs in a code comment or a [decision record](docs/decisions/); a user-facing change belongs in the README.

Leave specific comments, then approve or request changes. A maintainer does the actual merge.

## Filing an issue

**Think you've found a security vulnerability?** Don't open a public issue —
see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the private reporting channel.

Keep it light. Pick the matching template (bug, feature, or task) and fill in
what you know — you don't need to scope, size, or solve it. The most useful thing
you can provide for a bug is a way to reproduce it.

For bug reports, include:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (bill number, versions compared, command you ran)
- Any error output

That's enough. The team fleshes out the rest when grooming the issue for pickup.

### Filing from the command line

`gh issue create --body-file` and `--body` **bypass the templates above entirely**,
along with the `type:` they set. Templates apply only in the web UI or when you
pass `--template <file>`. So an issue filed from the CLI silently matches none of
the repo's structure and carries no issue type.

If you file from the CLI (or have an AI assistant do it), read the template file
in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and fill its sections yourself, then set the type
explicitly with `--type Bug` / `--type Feature` / `--type Task`.

For a defect you found from inside the codebase, or anything you've already
analyzed, use the fill-in skeleton in
**[docs/issue-analysis-template.md](docs/issue-analysis-template.md)**. It covers
what's wrong / how it surfaced / why it matters / what to do, plus the evidence
rules, and trims down for tasks and features.

### Writing an issue others can read

Whatever you file and however you file it, two habits do most of the work. Both
are about the reader who wasn't there when you found the problem:

- **Open with the observable problem, not the artifact that surfaced it.** State
  what's wrong before naming a file, test, or function. Someone without the repo
  open should finish your first sentence knowing what's broken and why it matters.
- **Make cross-references self-describing.** `#141 (enrolled PDFs yield no anchors)`,
  not a bare `#141`. If a sentence stops making sense when you delete the number,
  the number was doing the explaining. Same for decision records and for jargon:
  define project terms inline the first time you use them.

[docs/issue-analysis-template.md](docs/issue-analysis-template.md) has the full
shape and the reasoning behind it.

## Grooming an issue for pickup

Reporting and picking-up are two different jobs. Filing should be low-friction;
making an issue *ready to pick up* is the team's job, done during triage (the
**Backlog → Ready** move on the board, usually at the biweekly sync). An issue is
**Ready** when it answers:

- **Problem / why** — what's wrong or missing, and why it matters.
- **Acceptance criteria** — a short checklist of what "done" looks like.
- **Scope** — one line on what's in and out, so the work doesn't sprawl.
- **Where to start** — entry file(s) or the relevant doc.
- **Priority** — set the org-level Priority field: Urgent / High / Medium / Low (see below).
- **Effort** *(optional)* — set the org-level Effort field if useful; not a focus right now.

This keeps the bar to *report* low while still giving a newcomer everything they
need to *start*.

### Priority

Priority lives in the **org-level Priority issue field** (defined once for the
AgoraDMV org, so it's consistent across DeltaTrack and BillTrax), set during
grooming. Its values are **Urgent / High / Medium / Low**:

- **Urgent** — broken or trust-critical: wrong/lost diff output, silent data
  corruption. Drop other work for these.
- **High** — important correctness or coverage to do soon; cheap unblockers.
- **Medium** — coverage, fidelity, structure, contributor on-ramp. Most work.
- **Low** — cleanups, cosmetics, deferred decisions, nice-to-haves.

Priority is "the next-couple-weeks tier," not a permanent ranking — the **Ready**
column holds the current Urgent/High items, and we re-look at each sync. We track
priority in one place (the field), not also as labels, to avoid two competing
sources of truth.

Sizing is available via the org-level **Effort** field (High / Medium / Low) if a
piece of work needs it, but it isn't a focus right now — don't block grooming on
it.

### Sprints

The biweekly sync doubles as sprint planning. The **`Sprint` iteration field**
(two-week, Wednesday-aligned blocks) is the sprint container, and the current
iteration's title holds that cycle's **theme** ("this sprint: get the demo out").
Committing an issue to the sprint = set its `Sprint` to the current iteration and
move it to **Ready**. We don't freeze the sprint or size by points — critical
items are chosen by judgment, and other **Ready** work is fair game. Track the
active sprint on the **Current sprint** board view (`iteration:@current`).

## Epics

A larger effort that spans several pull requests is tracked as an **epic**: an
issue with the **`epic` label** that is broken into **sub-issues** (the smaller,
discrete pieces of work). Pick up the *sub-issues*, not the epic itself.

- The epic's progress is the **sub-issues progress bar** on the parent — it isn't
  dragged through the board columns like a normal issue.
- Each **sub-issue** flows the board normally and closes via its own
  `Closes #<n>` pull request. When all sub-issues are done, a maintainer closes
  the epic.
- Epics live on the **Roadmap** view; the working board filters them out, so the
  day-to-day columns show only discrete, pickup-ready work.

Reach for an epic only when work genuinely needs decomposing — most features are a
single issue.

## Questions?

Open an issue, ask in [Slack](https://civictechdc.slack.com/archives/C0AT13U25V2), or bring it to the [meetup](https://luma.com/civic-tech-dc). There are no dumb questions. See [Community](#community) for how to join.
