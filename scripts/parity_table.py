"""Emit the PDF↔XML change-parity table (#109, slice G of the #54 epic).

A reporting tool, NOT a gate — the same split as ``heading_precision.py``. The gate
is ``tests/test_pipeline_parity.py``, which asserts each bill's per-pipeline totals
stay inside its attributed band. This script recomputes those totals and prints the
human-readable snapshot recorded in
``docs/decisions/0014-leveled-heading-tree-scope.md``.

The table used to be a pytest case (``test_pipeline_change_parity_table``). It
asserted nothing, and it recomputed for all four bills what the parametrized per-bill
test had already computed — one monolithic case that ``pytest-xdist`` distributes
whole, so it was a hard floor on the suite's wall clock (#350). Reporting that
asserts nothing belongs in a script; the bands stay in the test.

This module owns the inputs (``PARITY_BILLS``, ``v1_v2``, ``totals``) and the test
imports them, so the bill list has one home. The test additionally asserts its band
table covers exactly ``PARITY_BILLS``, so the two cannot drift apart.

Exact cross-pipeline parity is not expected; only ``118-hr-8752`` matches. See the
test's module docstring and ADR 0014 for the attributed causes.
