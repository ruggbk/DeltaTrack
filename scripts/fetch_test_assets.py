"""Fetch external test assets that fetch_bills.py cannot produce.

A few slow tests read large PDF files fetched directly from govinfo (rather than
via fetch_bills.py, whose default format is XML). They are public domain
(17 U.S.C. 105) but large binaries, so they are gitignored and fetched on demand
here, keeping the test corpus reproducible without committing PDFs.

Currently:
- test_data/BILLS-118s4795rs.pdf - the reported-in-Senate (watermarked) print
  of S.4795, read by tests/test_pdf_watermark_recall.py.
- test_data/subcommittee/BILLS-118hr*rh.pdf - one FY2025 reported-in-House print
  per appropriations subcommittee, read by the major-level cross-subcommittee
  tests (DeltaTrack#105). Major/department heading vocabulary differs per
  subcommittee, so these guard against overfitting to one or two bills. CJS and
  Homeland are covered by existing fixtures (118-s-4795, 118-hr-8752).

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/fetch_test_assets.py        # fetch any missing assets
