"""Build tests/data/validation_<slug>.json for each committee-report jurisdiction.

External ground truth for #8: each Senate appropriations committee report is read for its
3-line account summary blocks (committee-recommendation amounts, in actual dollars), which
tests/test_validate_extraction.py validates against the reported bill's XML. Mirrors the
hand-curated validation_leg_branch.json, but generated deterministically from the report.

Report HTML and bill XML sources are committed (tracked since ADR 0015); the JSON fixtures are committed.
The jurisdiction registry lives in tests/validation_sources.py.
