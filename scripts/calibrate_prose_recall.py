"""Measure XML-prose-to-PDF recall across the corpus, to calibrate the floors in
tests/test_pdf_xml_prose_recall.py.

Those floors are budgets, and a budget calibrated on a sample is a budget that goes red
on the first unmeasured member. Run this over the whole fixture tree (and
`CORPUS_SWEEP=1` for the wider downloaded corpus) before changing one, and read the
misses: the point of the exercise is to know what the residue IS, not to pick a number
under it.

Results are grouped by print layout, because that is what the floors key on. A layout
whose worst member sits close to its floor is the one to look at, and a NEW layout
appearing in the corpus with a poor score is a defect to investigate rather than a floor
to add.

    uv run python scripts/calibrate_prose_recall.py [--misses N]

Exits non-zero when something needs attention, so it can be used as a check rather than
only read.
