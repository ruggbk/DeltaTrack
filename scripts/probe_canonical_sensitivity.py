"""Prove the canonical byte-identity gate reddens when move correspondence changes.

The acceptance criterion for every ADR 0020 Phase 1 slice is that
``tests/test_canonical_baseline.py`` stays green. A gate nobody has ever seen fail cannot
distinguish "the extraction preserved behaviour" from "the gate cannot see this class of
change" -- and correspondence is precisely the class it is being trusted for. So this
injects a real correspondence change and watches the digests move.

The fault is chosen to be the one #581 is most likely to introduce by accident:
**substituting ADR 0019 ordinals for the legacy ``(ri, ai)`` component of the sort key.**
The original experiment measured that this changes the selected move set on exactly 3 of
the 16 selecting corpus pairs, so the prediction is sharp -- and it is enforced as a
prediction rather than a remark: those exact three digests must move and no others. The
three pair keys are recorded below as observations from that experiment.

RE-AIMED FOR SLICE 2. The fault used to be injected by replacing ``diff_bill.reconcile_moves``,
a single post-classification function. That function is gone: round-2 retrieval, evidence and
assignment now run before classification, and the ordering key lives in
``diff_bill._greedy_move_links``. Injecting there keeps the fault on the LIVE production path --
``assign_moves`` calls it, ``diff_bills`` calls that -- rather than on a parallel copy of a
pipeline nothing runs any more, which is the only way this can still speak for the real gate.

The re-aim also made the fault sharper. The old probe needed an ``element_id -> ordinal``
bridge because ``NodeDiff`` carries no address; the migrated stages carry
:class:`~deltatrack.matching.ObservationRef`, whose ``ordinal`` IS the parser's
complete-sequence position. So the ordinal key is now read directly off the evidence and the
bridge is gone, along with the chance of it silently pointing at the wrong node.

FOUR PASSES, because a two-pass green/red would leave two other explanations open:

1. **production** -- the harness reproduces the committed baseline. Without this a later
   mismatch could be the harness rather than the fault. Must be EMPTY.
2. **duplicate, production key** -- the copied greedy loop below must reproduce the committed
   baseline too. A copy made in order to instrument something is a second implementation that
   can drift; unless it is shown equivalent first, pass 3 would be comparing the ordinal key
   against a drifted copy rather than against production. Must be EMPTY.
3. **duplicate, ordinal key** -- the injected fault. Must be EXACTLY the expected three.
4. **production, restored** -- the baseline matches again, so the difference was the fault
   and not something sticky the run left behind. Must be EMPTY.

An extra reddened pair, a missing one, or a different one fails the run. "Non-empty" would
have been satisfied by a fault that reddened everything, which is the shape a genuinely
broken harness produces.

Read-only with respect to the repository: it patches module attributes at runtime and
restores them, and writes no file. Exits non-zero on any failure. Run from the project

#: ``scripts/probe_round2_migration.py`` as it stood at 6e2964fb, and were imported from it
#: until #659 retired that probe: its durable claim was a Phase-1 preservation baseline, whose

#: survive a legitimate matching-policy change without re-transcribing a new pre-change
#: implementation. Three literal strings carry no such burden.
#:
#: They are still enforced exactly, and a drift is still a review gate rather than a number to
