"""Update corpus_manifest.toml with committee report pairings.

Comment-preserving: the manifest carries 40+ lines of documentation (why the file
exists, how the gates read it, how to add a fixture) that a load-and-dump through
a plain TOML writer silently deletes. tomlkit edits the document in place instead.

Two modes:

default (offline)
    Re-derive pairings from the report sources already recorded in the manifest.
    BILLSTATUS said which reports a bill has; that answer does not change, so
    re-applying the *pairing rules* needs no network. This is the mode to run
    after editing scripts/report_pairing.py.

``--refresh``
    Re-fetch BILLSTATUS for every bill and rebuild the source list from scratch.
    Needed only when a bill gains a report.

Package IDs are confirmed against govinfo before being recorded (``--refresh``
only): a predicted ID that does not resolve is stored as ``text_available =
false`` rather than as a fixture that will never exist.
