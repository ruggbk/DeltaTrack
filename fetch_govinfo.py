"""GovInfo bulk-data access for bill text + metadata.

Replaces the Congress.gov API (``fetch_bills.py``) for both discovery and text
retrieval (issue #10). Same legacy GPO DTD bill XML, served from
govinfo.gov/bulkdata -- no API key, no rate limit, 113th Congress forward. The
BILLS text is byte-for-byte identical to the Congress.gov "Formatted XML" we
download today, so ``bill_tree.py`` needs no parser changes.

Two access patterns over the same bytes:
  - per-bill on-demand fetch (:func:`fetch_bill_xml` / :func:`fetch_title`) for
    the diff tool's discovery/fetch path.
  - bulk per-(congress, session, type) ZIPs for building a multi-version test
    corpus (see ``fetch_bill_text_archives.py``, which builds on this module).

Two collections:
  - BILLS:      full bill *text* XML (legacy bill.dtd), one file per version.
  - BILLSTATUS: bill *metadata* (title, subjects, version dates) for discovery
                and authoritative version ordering.

URL shapes:
  text (one version): {BASE}/BILLS/{congress}/{session}/{type}/BILLS-{congress}{type}{number}{ver}.xml
  text (bulk ZIP):    {BASE}/BILLS/{congress}/{session}/{type}/BILLS-{congress}-{session}-{type}.zip
  status (one bill):  {BASE}/BILLSTATUS/{congress}/{type}/BILLSTATUS-{congress}{type}{number}.xml

Incorporates the per-bill fetch prototype (fetch_bill_xml / fetch_title /
sessions_for_congress), originally by @willhea.

# Bill version codes -> (display name, tier). Single source of truth; NAME_TO_CODE is
# derived below. The display name is sanitized to the slug the corpus uses ("Reported
# in House" -> reported-in-house), so a name that keys an on-disk corpus file cannot be
# changed without renaming that file (and breaking tests/test_govinfo_corpus_parity.py).
#
# The full authoritative code set is govinfo's (govinfo.gov/help/bills, 53 codes; the
# superset congress.gov's list is a subset of), inherited wholesale (#238) so no real
# code falls through resolve_code() to a tier-0 raw-code label -- the unreadable-
# filename bug (3_rth.xml) that #223 closed for rth/ris and #238 closes for all 53.
# Names: the codes that key on-disk corpus files keep their existing corpus-stable
# wording (which is also congress.gov's); the rest use authoritative wording. Where
# govinfo and congress.gov diverge only in the chamber suffix ("(House)" vs " House"),
# the existing table's no-parens style is used for consistency (parens sanitize away).

# our own construct (neither source publishes it), assigned by legislative stage:
# introduce=1, refer/receive/reference/held=2, report/calendar/discharge/print=3,
# engross/pass/agree/amend/dispose=4, enroll/print-as-passed=5. Only the ~10 codes with
# on-disk corpus files (ih, rfs, rds, rh, rs, pcs, eh, eah, eas, enr) have load-bearing
# tiers; the rest never appear in an appropriations bill, so their tiers are best-effort

# not serve. The marker persists that per bill, so a gap is findable without

# shapes it (#228 is deferred).
#
# SCOPE, precisely: markers are written only by the per-bill fetch path
# (fetch_bills' download / download-all). The bulk-convert path
# (fetch_bill_text_archives.convert_archives) builds bill directories without
# writing OR clearing them, so a bulk-built corpus carries none, and a marker left
# by a per-bill fetch can outlive a bulk refresh that delivered the missing XML.
# So this is not yet a corpus-wide coverage signal and must not be asserted on as
# one; closing that is tracked in #254.
#
# The name must not be mistaken for a bill version by anything that enumerates a
# bill directory. Current enumerators glob either digit-prefixed stems
# ("[0-9]*_*.xml") or bare extensions ("*.xml"/"*.pdf"), so a leading-underscore
# name with a .json suffix is invisible to both; the collision test pins that.
