"""Block-level diff for PDF bill versions, parallel to diff_bill.py for XML.

A bill is grouped into anchor-delimited blocks (TITLE / SEC. / account heading)
on each side, then aligned section-by-section. Lines before the first anchor
form a preamble block. The block is the natural unit of comparison — it mirrors
how `diff_bill.match_nodes` operates on BillTree nodes for XML and avoids the
SequenceMatcher line-level fragmentation that produced over-counted hunks and
missed added/moved sections.

Within matched blocks, the renderer applies word-level diff against the joined
block text. The classifier produces:

- `added` — block present only in v2
- `removed` — block present only in v1
- `moved` — block bodies similar but anchors differ (renumbered SEC.)
- `modified` — paired blocks with different bodies

Reuses amount extraction (`extract_amounts`, `match_amounts`) and text
similarity (`_text_similarity`) from diff_bill.py.
