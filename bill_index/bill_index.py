"""
A cache for bill metadata intended to accumulate information about large volumes of bills.

The guiding idea behind the cache is that each bill has an identifying slug of the form:

{congress}-{type}-{number}

e.g. `119-hr-1` for the 1st House Resolution bill of the 119th Congress.

Version is deliberately not part of the slug. A version is a per-bill ordinal addressed
as a separate token next to the bill, so its number and meaning are only defined under
one bill (ADR 0013). `shared/version_stems.py` resolves a slug + ordinal to a file.

Aside from a uniquely identifying slug, each bill can have arbitrary metadata.
The index automatically syncs with a CSV file. It can be used to prevent duplicate downloads
and to accumulate bill metadata from different sources.

Usage:
index = BillIndex(csv_path)
records: list[dict] = index.bills
bill_ids: list[str] = [record["id"] for record in records]
latest_hr_bills = index.fetch_all(119, "hr")
for congress, bill_type, bill_number in map(parse_bill_id, bill_ids):
    ...

    A second unquoting branch used to live here (``json.loads``, falling back to
    stripping the outer quotes and collapsing ``""``), which is why text that itself
    began and ended with a straight quote lost those quotes, and why the two branches
    disagreed about backslash escapes (#256).

    It was never the inverse of anything this module wrote: ``_format_csv_cell`` has
    emitted plain CSV quoting in every revision of this file and has never JSON-encoded
    a cell, so no on-disk index has ever needed JSON decoding. Removing it changes how
    a stored value reads only in the case it was corrupting.

    It no longer coerces digits to ``int`` either (#256). A CSV cell is text, and the
    reader guessed a type from the value's *shape* while ignoring which column it was
    reading, so any text that happened to be all digits came back as a number: a title
    of ``2024``, or worse, an ``id`` of ``12345``, which then crashed the
    ``--file <csv>`` download path on ``.strip()``.

    The alternative -- declaring a type per column -- was considered and rejected. This
    index is documented to carry *arbitrary* metadata, so a type registry would need
    every producer to register its columns and would still need a rule for the ones that
    did not. Returning text is also what the file actually holds. Callers that want a
    number convert at the point of use; nothing in the project reads the writer's
    counting columns (``actionCount``, ``daysActive``, ``historySize`` and peers) back
    out, so no caller loses anything here.
